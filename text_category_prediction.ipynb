thing killing a man you take away all he has and all he s ever gonna have will munny unforgiven i am beyond the under age group but i have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you i owned a toyota celica gt i decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche model years i narrowed it down to those two i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the but i decided to stop by my insurance agent s office on the way i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be years newer our lower risk division will continue to handle your account if you buy the porsche we ll have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double and if you go with a it s another story again we ll cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the and the is actually faster than the standard that doens t make sense that s what the book says we don t insure corvettes either for some reason the underwriters consider supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough high pressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft everyone s entitled to my opinion goldberg oasys dt navy mil imagination is more important than knowledge albert einstein i live in idaho when i was many years ago years i bought a trans am new insurance was about year when i turned it immediately dropped to year i had not had any accidents before or after this was strictly an age change that same rate stayed pretty much the same until i sold the car years ago my f pickup is about year less the

scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv centaur in october of after gravity assists of venus earth and jupiter in a vvejga trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of upon arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of titan the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about hours while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about flybys of titan and targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objectives of the mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of saturn s atmosphere rings and magnetosphere conduct close up studies of saturn s satellites and characterize titan s atmosphere and surface one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere these hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through titan s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini the first director of the paris observatory who discovered several of saturn s satellites and the major division in its rings the titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch

inhabitants without mercy while at the same time working to sabotage the ottoman army s war effort by destroying roads and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to ease russian occupation the atrocities committed by the armenian volunteer forces accompanying the russian army were so severe that the russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties the memoirs of many russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these

out of their homeland after one thousand years turkish and kurdish lands were empty of turks and kurds the survivors found a safe heaven in turkiye today x soviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by x soviet armenia today x soviet armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this

christian nation to protect it and one recalls that the jews took up their abode in fanatic turkey when they were expelled from europe especially spain by saintly christians and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and liberty as their fellow turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the rapacity of their common rulers to one brought up as most americans have been in the gladstonian and foreign missionary tradition the condition of the jews in turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable one readily reaches the conclusion that the jews in turkey were fortunate he also stated that they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population i want the documents of jews in latvia i think several other people on soc culture greek are

muslim population during the next two days while the small ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state the ottoman empire and to assist instead other invading russian armies their hope was their participation in the russian success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of ottoman territories armenian political leaders army officers and common soldiers began deserting in droves with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in at the beginning of world war i the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman s enemy increased drastically ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks armenian revolutionaries armed

were being assembled for their doom in the nazi concentration camps the armenian volunteers in germany formed the first armenian battalion to fight alongside the nazis in this battalion had grown into eight battalions of strong under the command of the former guerilla leader dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the short lived armenian dictatorship and the architect of the cold blooded genocide of million turks and kurds between an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party leaders in berlin which was recognized by the nazis encouraged by this the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler s policy of extermination of the jews this armenian nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an encore performance staged by the armenians during wwi when they back stabbed and exterminated million turks by colluding with the invading russian army furthermore as mccarthy put it the armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the ottomans admitted defeat and signed the mudros armistice with the allies october the allies had decided to create a greater armenia including the old russian province of yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of anatolia claimed by the armenian fanatics only the area called cilicia around the ottoman province of adana was to be excluded as it had already been claimed by the french the allies quickly set about attempting to disarm ottoman soldiers and other turks who could be expected to oppose their plans on april the british army occupied kars gave civilian and military power over to the armenians then withdrew the british planned for kars to be included in the armenian dictatorship even though the russian pre war census had shown kars province to be over muslim the turks of kars were effectively disarmed but the british could not disarm the kurds of the mountains the fate of the turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in eastern anatolia murder pillage genocide and the destruction of turkish homes and entire turkish villages drove the turks of kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the ottoman army the british had left the scene to the armenian genocide squads therefore few europeans were present to observe the genocide one british soldier colonel rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of otoman soldiers saw what was occurring rawlinson wired to his superiors in the interest of humanity the armenians should not be left in independent command of the moslim population as their troops being without discipline and not being under effective control atrocities were constantly being committed instead you post more armenian nonsense come again these european dashnags with headquarters in berlin appealed to lines

buildings of these cities were deliberately burnt by armenians apart from the destruction suffered during the two year russian occupation all barracks buildings of erzincan the cavalry barracks in erzurum the government building and army corps headquarters are among those burnt in short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down as to the people of these cities all people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the sarikamis direction for road building and were slaughtered the remaining people were subject to cruelties and murder by armenians following the withdrawal of russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts the few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than those of the spanish inquisition are in poverty more dead than alive horrified

able to exist with some provisions found in stores left over from the russians the villages round erzincan and erzurum are in the worst condition some villages on the road have been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely massacred let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions a long list a

faq has been removed please refer to his posting or the archived copy for the most up to date information on upcoming missions call info at kennedy space center official nasa shuttle status reports are posted to sci space news frequently why does the shuttle roll just after liftoff the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc g c says during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is commanded until an i loaded v rel sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved then the tilt maneuver roll program orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q alpha which in turn alleviates structural loading other advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved s band look angles and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target in second stage this really is a good answer but it s couched in nasa jargon i ll try to interpret we wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly negative angle a negative q alpha this causes a little bit of downward force toward the belly of the orbiter or the z direction and this force alleviates structural loading we have to be careful about those wings they re about the most delicate part of the vehicle the new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn t roll performance gain the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers the return to launch site decreased abort maneuver complexity the new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio antennae to have a good line of sight signal with the s band radio antennae on the orbiter improved s band look angles the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine the new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usually this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction the shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit this all begs the question why isn t the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with why does the shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer is that the pads were leftovers from the apollo days the shuttle straddles two flame trenches one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effects of this on any daytime launch the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust is fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top orbiter side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the saturn v s a side note the saturn v s also had a roll program don t ask me why i m a shuttle guy i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics he added that the roll maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack q alpha within a tight tolerance the yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a grad level math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four element array how to

org jayne kulikauskas writes deletia no free gifts speil nuked by moderator fiat i find that i am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves little in the cosmic sense ah in the cosmic sence but who lives in the cosmic sence not me cosmicly we don t even exist for all practical purposes i can hardly use the cosmic sence of stuff as a guide to life it would just say don t bother luckily for mortals there are many sences of scale you can talk about in a human sence you can have big purposes even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind eventually to be turned into dust but the influence of aristotle confucious alexander ceasar and countless others is still with us although their works have perished but they have changed to course of history and while humanity exists their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing even if they are utterly forgotten mankind itself will one day perish one day surely well unless you believe in the second coming which i do not but in that time we can make a difference without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical without god it is all pointless in the end in the end but it must be the end until then there is all the point you can muster and when that end comes there will be nobody to ask gee i don t think james sledd s deeds are gonna make much of a difference ulitmately ya know but they will have already have made a difference great or small before the end why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile most people are able to live with that and for them little purposes success money power effecting change helping others suffice little is in the eye of the beholder of course i suppose they never think about the cosmic scale or are at least able to put it out of their minds i don t doubt it but i have thought about the cosmic scale and it does not seem to mean much to us here today to me it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion i would not find this comforting but perhaps it is merely my definitions here s what i think the relevant terms are reality that which is real illusion that which is not real but seems to be real objectively existing for reality to be an illusion would mean then that which is real is not real but seems to be or that which objectively exists does not objectively exist but does seem to objectively exist from which we can conclude that unless you want to get a contradiction that no things objectively exist but i have a problem with this because i would like to say that i objectively exist if nothing else cogito ergo sum and all that perhaps you do not mean all that but rather mean objective reality is unreachable by humans which is not so bad and so far as i know is true that the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit have on if reality is an illusion isn t true reality an illusion too and if true reality is spirit doens t that make spirit an illusion as well if i am not distinctly confused this is getting positively buddhist that this world is a school of sorts where we learn and grow and our souls mature that is one hell of a statement although perhaps true do you mean to imply that it was intended to be so if so please show that this is true if not please explain how this can give a purpose to anything that gives a purpose to my little purposes how does it do that wouldn t the world school w intent idea make the world a preparation for some greater purpose rather than a purpose in itself and takes some of the pressure off what pressure it s not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you re really just here to learn it is not necessary to be a success in human terms unless your goals either include doing so or require doing so before they themselves can be achived indeed many people have set goals for themselves that do not include success in human terms as i understand it check out yer buddhist monk type guy out for nirvana which is not at all the same thing it s more important to progress grow persist to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love especially when it s dificult to do so honest effort is rewarded by god he knows our limitations why is learning to love a goal what happens if you fail in this goal to you to god to the mysterious purpose

geno says if i don t think my belief is right and everyone else s belief is wrong then i don t have a belief this is simply what belief means unfortunatly this seems to be how christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion this is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is or was taught to think it is the fundamental premis a is not not a if a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false without this basic asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible we should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word believe however the weak sense means i am not sure i believe tom went to the library but he could have gone to the track the strong sense means i am so certain that i use it as a basis of thought i believe that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws despite the fact that nature appears capricious and unpredictable christian belief is of the strong kind though christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topics some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the only one and if you don t accept their teachings then you won t be saved note that these are two separate ideas most hold the first view but the majority do not hold the second is is again a matter of pure logic that if christanity is true then hinduism for example must necessarilly be false insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with christaianity and as a matter of logic vice versa it takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what god thinks wants it is arrogant to claim to know what anyone thinks or wants unless they have told you christians believe god has told us what he thinks and wants especially when it s based upon your interpretation of a book most christians do not base their belief on the bible but on the living tradition of the church established by christ and guided constantly by the holy spirit the bible is simply the written core of that tradition the logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can t both be correct if depends what you mean by differing if i believe tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs pounds our beliefs differ but we may both be right if i believe tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine one of us at least must be wrong it s all about perception no two people are exactly alike no two people perceive everything in the same way i believe that there is one truth call it god s truth a universal truth or call it what you will i don t believe god presents this truth i think it is just there and it s up to you to look for and see it through prayer meditation inspir ation dreams or whatever just because people may perceive this truth differently it doesn t mean one is wrong and the other is right thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being can find it you assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth is mistaken in short you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong qed as an example take the question is the glass half empty or half full you can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct so for your belief to be true does not require everyone else s belief to be wrong here i begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth but simply with language saying that the glass is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full it is the same fact expressed in different words the whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the same fact it is of course quite true that different people may express the same belief in different words it is also true that they may fail to understand each other s words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart great scisms have occurred in just this way and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief this does not mean in any sense that all beliefs are equally valid since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away some of the beliefs that some people hold must necessarilly be false and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so if i believe x and you believe y we may both be correct but if y is equivalent to not x then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs we must each regard the other as in error mark baker the task is not to cut down

constantinople as opposed to the western empire of rome the patriarchs and popes of alexandria played leading roles in christian theology they were invited everywhere to speak about the christian faith st cyril pope of alexandria was the head of the ecumenical council which was held in ephesus in the year a d it was said that the bishops of the church of alexandria did nothing but spend all their time in meetings this leading role however did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with church affairs it all started when the emperor marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the church the response of st dioscorus the pope of alexandria who was later exiled to this interference was clear you have nothing to do with the church these political motives became even more apparent in chalcedon in when the coptic church was unfairly accused of following the teachings of eutyches who believed in monophysitism this doctrine maintains that the lord jesus christ has only one nature the divine not two natures the human as well as the divine the coptic church has never believed in monophysitism the way it was portrayed in the council of chalcedon in that council monophysitism meant believing in one nature copts believe that the lord is perfect in his divinity and he is perfect in his humanity but his divinity and his humanity were united in one nature called the nature of the incarnate word which was reiterated by st cyril of alexandria copts thus believe in two natures human and divine that are united in one without mingling without confusion and without alteration from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy these two natures did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye also from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy the coptic church was misunderstood in the th century at the council of chalcedon perhaps the council understood the church correctly but they wanted to exile the church to isolate it and to abolish the egyptian independent pope despite all of this the coptic church has remained very strict and steadfast in its faith whether it was a conspiracy from the western churches to exile the coptic church as a punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced or whether pope dioscurus didn t quite go the extra mile to make the point that copts are not monophysite the coptic church has always felt a mandate to reconcile semantic differences between all christian churches this is aptly expressed by the current th successor of st mark pope shenouda iii to the coptic church faith is more important than anything and others must know that semantics and terminology are of little importance to us throughout this century the coptic church has played an important role in the ecumenical movement the coptic church is one of the founders of the world council of churches it has remained a member of that council since a d the coptic church is a member of the all african council of churches aacc and the middle east council of churches mecc the church plays an important role in the christian movement by conducting dialogues aiming at resolving the theological differences with the catholic greek orthodox presbyterian and evangelical churches as a final note the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign a common statement of christology in which the heresey of monophysitism was condemned so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in monophysitism peace nabil nabil ayoub engine research center dept of mechanical engineering university of wisconsin madison email ayoub erctitan me wisc edu as i mentioned in a brief apology the comment quoted above from me is confused i appear to say that nestorius was monophysite as andrew byler correctly stated it the nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties the point i was making which nabil explains in some detail is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably aren t chalcedon was a compromise between two groups the alexandrians and antiochenes it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes i agree that there were extremes that were heretical however in the course of the complex politics of the time it appears that some people got rejected who didn t intend heresy but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented and some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine there are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps this posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians there are also a remaining nestorians like some of the current so called monophysites there is reason to believe that the current so called nestorians are not heretical either they sheltered nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment but claim they did not adopt his heresies and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the antiochene tradition clh',\n",

       " 'from db n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler subject the nicene creed was re major views of the trinity organization freshman civil engineering carnegie mellon pittsburgh pa lines michael bushnell writes the so called creed of athanasius however has always been a western creed and has always had the filioque the orthodox have said that they accept all that it says with the exception of the filioque but it is not in use which is exactly what i pointed out though i was wrong about your use of the creed the catholic encylcopedia in which i read about it said the orthodox do use the creed minus the filioque apparently that has changed the athanasian creed has always had the filioque the nicene constantinopolitan did not of course the orthodox did not delete the filioque from the nicene creed it wasn t there to begin with but they certainly did from the athanasian creed which did have it from the beginning i might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the blessed trinity the east emphasizing the idea of the holy spirit proceeding from the father through the son and the west using proceeding from the father and the son in fact some such as tertullian used both formulations see below following therefore the form of these examples i profess that i do call god and his word the father and and his son two for the root and the stem are two things but conjoined the fountain and the river are two kinds but indivisible the sun and the ray are two forms but coherent ones anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds but it is not on that account separated from it where there is second however there are two and where ther is third there are three the spirit then is third from god and the son just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem and third from the fountain is the stream from the river and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray tertullian against praxeas about ad and i believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the father through the son tertullian against praxeas about ad and as st thomas showed in his summa theologica part question articles and there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation and in fact the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what st augustine among others taught that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and the son but he proceeds from the father in a more preeminent way for whatever the son has he has from the father certainly he has it from the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him for the father alone is not from another for which reason he alone is called unbegotten not indeed in the scriptures but in the practice of theologians and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great the son however is born of the father and the holy spirit proceeds principally from the father and since the father gives to the son all that he has without any interval of time the holy spirit proceeds jointly from both father and son he would be called son of the father and of the son if which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind they had both begotten him the spirit was not begotten by each however but proceeds from each and both st augustine of hippo the trinity to ad so in a sense all of the formulations are correct to the west at least because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and son but in proceeding from the son the orgin of that procession is the procession from the father so the holy spirit is proceeding from the father through the son but as all that the son has is from the father the holy spirit can be said to proceed from the father without any mention of the son being necessary in any case i am happy to know that i follow in the beliefs of pope st leo i st fulgence of ruspe st cyril of alexandria pope st damsus i st augustine of hippo st epiphanius of salamis st ambrose of milan st hilary of poitiers tertullian and others among the fathers who all have very quotable quotes supporting the catholic position which i enunciated above as for the issue of the adoption of another creed being forbidden i will point out that the holy fathers of ephesus and chalcedon both spoke of the creed of nicea in their statement forbidding anyone to produce write or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the fathers of nicea that creed is a different creed than that of constantinople which is commonly called the nicene creed not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the constantinopolitan creed which is but an enlargement upon the creed of nicea but that they were condemning the impious opinions of nestorious who had adopted a radically different creed from the one used by the church which among other things denied the procession of the holy spirit form the son thus the additions of the constantinopolitan creed were not thought to be in violation of this and as the council chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the holy spirit from the son which nestorius denied they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the creed for they themselves approved of previous additions to it and if the further explanations of the creed made in constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the holy fathers of nicea or in any way heretical it follows that the council of toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the creed so as to combat the impieties of the arians in spain because the filioque was not in dispute in the church until many years later under photius and others and that the filioque was not disputed i provide more quotes below since the holy spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to god and he actually proceeds from the father and son it is abundantly clear that he is of the divine essence in it in essence and proceeding from it st cyril of alexandria the treasury of the holy and consubstantial trinity thesis ad the holy spirit is not of the father only or of the son only but he is the spirit of the father and the son for it is written if anyone loves the world the spirit of the father is not in him and again it is written if anyone however does not have the spirit of christ he is none of his when the father and the son are named in this way the holy spirit is understood of whom the son himself says in the gospel that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and that he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you pope st damasus i the decree of damasus ad the only begotten holy spirit has neither the name of the son nor the appelation of father but is called holy spirit and is not foreign to the father for the only begotten himself calls him the spirit of the father and says of him the he proceeds from the father and will receive of mine so that he is reckoned as not being foreign to the son but is of their same substance of the same godhead he is spirit divine of god and he is god for he is spirit of god spirit of the father and spirit of the son not by some kind of synthesis like soul and body in us but in the midst of father and son of the father and of the son a third by appelation the father always existed and the son always existed and the spirit breathes from the father and the son and neither is the son created nor is the spirit created st epiphanius of salamis which is on cyprus the man well anchored and ad concerning the holy spirit i ought not to remain silent nor yet is it necessary to speak still on account of those who do not know him it is not possible for me to be silent however it is necessary to speak of him who must be acknowledged who is from the father and the son his sources st hilary of poitiers the trintiy to ad thus as i have pointed out before gaul spain italy africa egypt palastine and the lands of the greeks all of christnedom at that time all have fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque i suggest to those of the orthodox church that they come up with some of the fathers besides st john of

       " 'from mathew mathew mantis co uk subject alt atheism faq constructing a logical argument summary includes a list of logical fallacies keywords faq atheism argument fallacies logic expires thu may gmt distribution world organization mantis consultants cambridge uk supersedes mantis co uk lines archive name atheism logic alt atheism archive name logic last modified april version constructing a logical argument although there is much argument on usenet the general quality of argument found is poor this article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference concise oed logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable the matter is very much open for debate this document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical argument a proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example it is raining or today is tuesday propositions may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning the proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express it so god exists and there exists a god both express the same proposition an argument is to quote the monty python sketch a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition an argument consists of three stages first of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated these are called the premises of the argument they are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as because since obviously and so on the phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises if something doesn t seem obvious to you don t be afraid to question it you can always say oh yes you re right it is obvious when you ve heard the explanation next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference in inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted there are various forms of valid inference the propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude and so on the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference for example every event has a cause premise the universe has a beginning premise all beginnings involve an event premise this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolation sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion this is perfectly valid if sometimes a little confusing recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument some statements look like arguments but are not for example if the bible is accurate jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the son of god this is not an argument it is a conditional statement it does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but we ll come to those later another example god created you therefore do your duty to god the phrase do your duty to god is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument finally causality is important consider a statement of the form a because b if we re interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence the statement is an argument if we re trying to establish the truth of b then it is not an argument it is an explanation for example there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start this is an argument my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine this is an explanation there are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive a deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true a deductive argument is either valid or invalid a valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is true an inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are there are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds this is because of the slightly counter intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions for example all insects have wings premise woodlice are insects premise therefore woodlice have wings conclusion here the conclusion is not true because the argument s premises are false if the argument s premises were true however the conclusion would be true the argument is thus entirely valid more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in all fish live in the sea premise dolphins are fish premise therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises we can therefore draw up a truth table for implication the symbol denotes implication a is the premise b the conclusion t and f represent true and false respectively premise conclusion inference a b a b f f t if the premises are false and the inference f t t valid the conclusion can be true or false t f f if the premises are true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid t t t if the premises are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true a sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true a sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments to delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy it is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument these pitfalls are known as fallacies in everyday english the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs this is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing so for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely by studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them the following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal to force the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion it is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer for example thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion this is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it for example atheism is an evil philosophy it is practised by communists and murderers sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known perjurer this is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witness s testimony is false to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent s particular circumstances for example it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food how can you argue otherwise when you re quite happy to wear leather shoes this is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent s argument this fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion for example of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing you re white this particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one alleges that one s adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as poisoning the well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance this fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific principle examples of course the bible is true nobody can prove otherwise of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist nobody has shown any proof that they are real note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur for example a flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth the earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles therefore no such flood occurred in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred we cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however argumentum ad misericordiam this is the appeal to pity also known as special pleading the fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted for example i did not murder my mother and father with an axe please don t find me guilty i m suffering enough through being an orphan argumentum ad populum this is known as appealing to the gallery or appealing to the people to commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people this form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language for example pornography must be banned it is violence against women the bible must be true millions of people know that it is are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools argumentum ad numeram this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum it consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion for example isaac newton was a genius and he believed in god this line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject for example we can distinguish quite clearly between stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and john searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed searle is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is well qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable it is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific for example christians generally dislike atheists you are a christian so you must dislike atheists this fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules converse accident hasty generalization this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident it occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases for example jim bakker was an insincere christian therefore all christians are insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter a sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these are known as false cause fallacies the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause for example i took an aspirin and prayed to god and my headache disappeared so god cured me of the headache the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event for example the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons cum hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc it asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause s of the events petitio principii this fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached circulus in demonstrando this fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument for example homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the conclusion an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the british secret services official ban on homosexual employees another example is the classic we know that god exists because the bible tells us so and we know that the bible is true because it is the word of god complex question fallacy of interrogation this is the fallacy of presupposition one example is the classic loaded question have you stopped beating your wife the question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked this trick is often used by lawyers in cross examination when they ask questions like where did you hide the money you stole similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as how long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continue or does the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion for example a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of christianity are undoubtably true if he then argues at length that christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that christian teachings are true sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument for example what could be more affordable than free software but to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing accent accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning in this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized for example consider we should not speak ill of our friends and we should not speak ill of our friends fallacies of composition one fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole for example the bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very lightweight the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items for example a car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses fallacy of division the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition like its opposite it exists in two varieties the first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts for example you are studying at a rich college therefore you must be rich the other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item for example ants can destroy a tree therefore this ant can destroy a tree the slippery slope argument this argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful events there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event for example if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we ll have a nation full of drug addicts on welfare therefore we cannot legalize marijuana a is based on b fallacies is a type of fallacies these fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar examples isn t history based upon faith if so then isn t the bible also a form of history islam is based on faith christianity is based on faith so isn t islam a form of christianity cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so aren t dogs a form of cat affirmation of the consequent this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b b is true therefore a is true to understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier denial of the antecedent this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa the latter has the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false where a does not in fact imply b at all here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce anything about b converting a conditional this fallacy is an argument of the form if a then b therefore if b then a argumentum ad antiquitam this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because that s the way it s always been argumentum ad novitam this is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else argumentum ad crumenam the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right argumentum ad lazarum the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier this fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard an argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something bifurcation also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist plurium interrogationum many questions this fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question non sequitur a non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it red herring this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyone s attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing shifting the burden of proof the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made the source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise straw man the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else s position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished it is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made the extended analogy the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other this fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti cryptography legislation i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported martin luther king are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for black liberation how dare you tu quoque this is the famous you too fallacy it occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it for instance you re just being randomly abusive so you ve been abusive too',\n",

polymenakos writes well zumabot claims just the opposite that greeks are not allowing turks to exit the country now explain this the number of turks in thrace has steadily risen from in to while the greeks of dr goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally be believed i have been observing that poly has been practicing goebels rule quite loyally poly s audience is mostly made of greeks who are not allowed to listen to turkish news however in today s informed world greek propagandists can only fool themselves for instance those who lived in will remember the tv news they watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can read the american newspapers of july and august to find out what really happened there are in turkiye the greek hospital the greek girls lycee alumni association the principo islands greek benevolent society the greek medical foundation the principo greek orphanage foundation the yovakimion greek girls lycee foundation and the fener greek men s lycee foundation as for greece the longstanding use of the adjective turkish in titles and on signboards is prohibited the greek courts have ordered the closure of the turkish teachers association the komotini turkish youth association and the ksanti turkish association on grounds that there are no turks in western thrace such community associations had been active until but they were first told to remove the word turkish on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down this is also the final verdict november of the greek high court in the city of komotini a former greek parliamentarian of turkish parentage was sentenced recently to months of imprisonment with no right to appeal just for saying outloud that he was of turkish descent this duly elected ethnic turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three years each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than a vehicle used by the greek governments to cover up their inferiority complex they display vis a vis the people of turkiye the agreement on the exchange of minorities uses the term turks which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to muslims the fact that the greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non turkish muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in western thrace a much bigger turkish minority the pomaks are also a muslim people whom all the three nations bulgarians turks and greeks consider as part of themselves do you know how the muslim turkish minority was organized according to the agreements poor poly it also proves that the turkish people are trapped in greece and the greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world the greek authorities deny even the existence of a turkish minority they pursue the same denial in connection with the macedonians of greece talk about oppression in addition in the democratic greek parliament passed law no virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts they have ceased to be self supporting religious and cultural entities talk about fascism the greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus irrespective of the will of the turkish minority as state official although the orthodox church has full authority in similar matters in greece the muslim turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders talk about democracy the government of greece has recently destroyed an islamic convention in komotini such destruction which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the lausanne convention as well as the so called greek constitution which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments the government of greece on the other hand is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward hellenizing the region and you pondered sidiropoulos the president of the macedonian human rights committee became the latest victim of a tactic long used by the greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation of the macedonian minority a forestry official by occupation sidiropoulos has been sent to internal exile on the island of kefalonia hundreds of kilometers away from his native florina his employer the florina city council asked him to depart in hours the greek authorities are trying to punish him for his involvement in copenhagen he returned to florina by his own choice and remains without a job helsinki watch a well known human rights group had been investigating the plight of the turkish minority in greece in august their findings were published in a report titled destroying ethnic identity turks of greece the report confirmed gross violations of the human rights of the turkish minority by the greek authorities it says for instance the greek government recently destroyed an islamic convent in komotini such destruction which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the lausanne convention the turkish cemeteries in the village of vafeika and in pinarlik were attacked and tombstones were broken the cemetery in karotas was razed by bulldozers shall i go on why not the people of turkiye are not going to take human rights lessons from the greek government the discussion of human rights violations in greece does not stop at the greek frontier in several following articles i shall dwell on and expose the greek treatment of turks in western thrace and the aegean macedonians it has been reported that the greek cypriot administration has an intense desire for arms and that greece has made plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on conventional arms reductions in europe meanwhile greek and greek cypriot officials are reported to have planned to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern cyprus a process that will conflict with the spirit of the agreement on conventional arms reduction in europe an acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will but we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings the rugs at the amfia village mosque were dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there shots were fired on the mosque in the village of aryana now wait there is more greek atrocities in the vilayet of smyrna may to july inedited documents and evidence of english and french officers published by the permanent bureau of the turkish congress at lausanne lausanne imprimerie petter giesser held caroline pages the train going from denizli to smyrna was stopped at ephesus and the turkish travellers men and women who were in it ordered to descend and there in the open street under the eyes of their husbands fathers and brothers the women without distinction of age were violated and then all the travellers were massacred amongst the latter the lieutenant salih effendi a native of tripoli and a captain whose name is not known and to whom the hellenic authorities had given safe conduct were killed with specially atrocious tortures before the battle the wife of the lawyer enver bey coming from her garden was maltreated by greek soldiers she was even stript of her garments and her servant assie was violated the two tax gatherers mustapha and ali effendi were killed in the following manner their arms were bound behind their backs with wire and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt end of a gun during the firing of the town eleven children six little girls and five boys fleeing from the flames were stopped by greek soldiers in the ramazan pacha quarter and thrown into a burning jewish house near bridge where they were burnt alive this fact is confirmed on oath by the retired commandant hussein hussni effendi who saw it the clock maker ahmed effendi and his son sadi were arrested and dragged out of their shop the son had his eyes put out and was then killed in the court of the greek church but ahmed effendi has been no more heard of at the market during the fire two unknown people were wounded by bayonets then bound together thrown into the fire and burnt alive the greeks killed also many jews these are the names of some moussa malki shoemaker killed bohor levy tailor killed bohor israel cobbler killed isaac calvo shoemaker

       " 'from cdt sw stratus com c d tavares subject re long gun hearings day in massachusetts april organization stratus computer inc lines distribution usa nntp posting host rocket sw stratus com this is a co authored report from two of us who were there gun owners action league our state rifle association started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at it was looking sparse about people until the speaker began whereupon about more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost and filled out the area something proud mike yacino of goal spoke one of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state while the people in the statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of election fraud to hold their jobs nancy snow and amos hamburger were busy handing out id buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings and telling people where to find their own representatives and in too many cases who they were mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn t made it onto the official list it seems a delegation of students from simon s rock of bard college alma mater of wayne lo who shot up the place with an sks late last year was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident the hearings were originally scheduled in the large gardner auditorium at but that had been pre empted by the governor s hearings on the framingham eight women in prison for killing abusive husbands and seeking release so we had until to buttonhole our representatives after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room one of my representatives staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy he said oh it must be gun hearings day again the gun lobby is always so organized every year i got a little pissed and replied i m not from the gun lobby i m from your district at your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse where the pro gunners weren t randy price from the tv news was there in his mirror reflective shades talking to one of the anti gun types and several simon s rock anti gun close the loophole protestors earlier randy had covered the goal rally the room we had been assigned seated about remember there were about gun owners there plus another students and teachers from bard one of us had already reserved a seat the other never got closer than the atrium outside and there was a crowd behind him a cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in soon after the debate started a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else everyone who was there inside and outside got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills most of us signed up to support goal s position on all bills first because of their time constraints public officials got to testify and first up was the bill that nobody had seen the students had some curfew i guess currently massachusetts law allows a non resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state previously the law was similar but applied only to non residents from states adjoining massachusetts the simon s rock folks called the current law a loophole and wanted it closed two of their reps spoke about wayne lo and his sks assault rifle the second one hodgekiss a co sponsor had done his homework so well that he kept confusing montana wayne lo s home state with missouri and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff carr from gloucester claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was but he was lying the new bill allows purchases by non residents of adjoining states only if they have licensing in their own state as strong as that in massachusetts since none of them do that s that some of the things these two said were really offensive in some of these other states anyone can buy a gun as long as he s breathing oooooo we have some very very good gun laws in massachusetts if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws we wouldn t be having this situation but they won t naughty naughty next up was boston city councilman albert dapper o neill he was there to testify pro gun but in some ways he was a liability he s reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself plus he s almost a caricature of a law n order politician he badmouthed the aclu said violent criminals should be executed and that if he were judge he d give arrestees their last rights pun intended on the spot at which many of the gun owners applauded which bothered me he said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction for the criminals he said this four times two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a ccw or fid and confiscate all your guns if someone had filed a restraining order against you note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant no hearing no evidence and no conviction just an accusation senator barrett of reading testified in favor of it and patronized the pro gunners there several times by saying i m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted i haven t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since nixon whined that he wasn t a crook barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the fid card renewable every five years instead of permanent as it is now the stated purpose is to remove fid cards from those who have become ineligible revenue has nothing to do with it yeah right apparently some congressmen think we re stupid enough to swallow the argument that it s preferable to process million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time as usual hassle the law abiding instead of the crook the two co chairs of the committee were rep caron and sen jujuga jujuga didn t say much he was a co sponsor of both restraining order bills but caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn t let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged he was a co sponsor of one of the restraining order bills as well one of the younger reps on the committee forgot his name was vociferously pro gun somewhat embarrassingly so his heart was in the right place but his arguments seemed to be confined to every year it s the same damn thing you come in here with this crap it s nice to have a friend on the committee but he could have been more effective at about it was clear that the hall jam couldn t continue someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting so the loudspeaker was disconnected so they found a bigger hall upstairs one of us had to leave to catch his charter bus and so missed the public testimony the other got a seat this time caron began by talking about how he got his fid years ago left the state and then returned without notifying them of his address change he complained that the state record system was not up to date and that his pd back in his city of birth still thought he lived there great quote if you purchase a gun today it will not get into the state computer system until this was also an argument he used against the renewable fid card testimony was heard from several battered women one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his s who had an fid card because he got it when he was or thereabouts they used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men a staffer of attorney general harshbarger testified in favor of this anti gun bill saying how restraining orders were granted last year and how these women needed to be protected caron noted that a restraining order was granted for days and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year he asked whether she would be satisfied if the fid were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the fid she gave some long rambling circumlocution in response then testimony against the bill was heard mike yacino who looks something like einstein got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right man or woman and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts atty karen mcnutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony other pro gunners got up to testify one said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out and that she countered by filing one against him he noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law one of the junior reps noted that this is america and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected senator jujuga reiterated this saying that people who abuse smaller people can go to hell as far as i care but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order point and match senator another pro gunner got up and testified that he didn t know his citizenship expired every years and that a driver s license was a privilege not a right like the right to keep and bear arms a third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings senator jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed and joking responded that he too favored public hangings the speaker then responded i ll make you a deal you get me the rope and i ll tie the noose next came public testimony on the simon s rock bill a teacher testified that she had been the teacher of wayne lo and that he wouldn t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside without his evil gun she said that the loophole should be closed to prevent something like this from ever happening again four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill one of spilling tears for the good legislators one of the students actually shot by wayne lo was also there many of them had t shirts on saying as long as one person can buy a gun in anger none of us are safe support gun control the committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids except for caron who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an fid only residents can get fid s he said how much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out of staters completely off yacino and mcnutt spoke again this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo and all guns possessed by out of staters karen also noted that hunters in ct nh and vt could be put away for a year if they wandered across the ma boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens yacino underscored the fact that lo could have gotten an fid as a resident student and hell even an ccw as he had no criminal or mental record one junior rep was upset that it would take ma residents longer to buy a gun than out of staters and thought it was elitist another caron said that we need the protection of preventing non residents from buying without an fid because only two other states in the union had fid type cards so complying with all the laws of one s home state was not enough one pro gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming everyone s out of step but johnny all the bard college people were filing out as the pro gun testimony for this bill was made and thus only pro gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration the main bills remaining and goal s position were o h and four others notify police chiefs so they can pull licenses when a holder is convicted strongly supported o h require trigger locks on all handguns sold opposed o h require trigger locks on all loaded firearms strongly opposed o h allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws opposed o h fund bullet proof vests for municipal police supported o s state constitutional amendment for the rkba supported o several on police discretion in the issuance of fid cards opposed o several altering non resident license conditions supported o h ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state guess some of these took only seconds to consider as the remaining pro gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them mike yacino noted that besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked caron blew right through h when he saw that we opposed it again he brought up the state s archaic records capability and said this would create hundreds of different licensing systems the session ran late since it was the last scheduled hearing it could not be

short form authored by henry spencer then an official nasa announcement q how do i become an astronaut a we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut since it s probably impossible for a non russian to get into the cosmonaut corps paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts and the other nations have so few astronauts and fly even fewer that you re better off hoping to win a lottery becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast jet experience which means a military flying career forget that unless you want to do it anyway so you want to become a shuttle mission specialist if you aren t a us citizen become one that is a must after that the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply nasa s problem is not finding qualified people but thinning the lineup down to manageable length it is not enough to be qualified you must avoid being dis qualified for any reason many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job get a ph d specialize in something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil forget computer programming entirely it will be done from the ground for the fore seeable future degree s in one field plus work experience in another seems to be a frequent winner be in good physical condition with good eyesight do not get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would do to rked eyes and long term effects are poorly understood for that matter avoid any other significant medical unknowns if you can pass a jet pilot physical you should be okay if you can t your chances are poor practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in appearance and actions you ve got a tough selling job ahead trying to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds of other applicants and also that you will be a credit to nasa after you are hired public relations is a significant part of the job and nasa s image is very prim and proper the image you want is squeaky clean workaholic yuppie remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent keep your nose clean get a pilot s license and make flying your number one hobby experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non pilot jobs work for nasa of astronauts selected between and were military or nasa employees and the remaining two were a nasa consultant and mae jemison the first black female astronaut if you apply from outside nasa and miss but they offer you a job at nasa take it sometimes in the past this has meant you do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first think space they want highly motivated people so lose

mission specialist astronaut candidates to support the space shuttle program nasa is now accepting on a continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be considered all positions are located at the lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas and will involved a year training and evaluation program space shuttle program description the numerous successful flights of the space shuttle have demonstrated that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming routine the space shuttle orbiter is launched into and maneuvers in the earth orbit performing missions lastling up to days it then returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and flight crew the orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment and retrieval of satellites service of existing satellites operation of specialized laboratories astronomy earth sciences materials processing manufacturing and other operations these missions will eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space station the orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher orbits than can be achieved by the orbiter itself users of the space shuttle s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include government agencies and private industries the crew normally consists of five people the commander the pilot and three mission specialists on occasion additional crew members are assigned the commander pilot and mission specialists are nasa astronauts pilot astronaut pilot astronauts server as both space shuttle commanders and pilots during flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle crew mission success and safety in flight the pilot assists the commander in controlling and operating the vehicle in addition the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing the remote manipulator system in extra vehicular activities and other payload operations mission specialist astronaut mission specialist astronauts working with the commander and pilot have overall responsibility for the coordination of shuttle operations in the areas of crew activity planning consumables usage and experiment and payload operations mission specialists are required to have a detailed knowledge of shuttle systems as

going on i told the second secretary of the district party committee what had been going on and said i wanted to take my crew off the site they wouldn t allow it they said nothing s going to happen to you we ve entrusted the matter to the police we ve warned everyone in the district nothing will happen to you well in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me he knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened this man didn t leave me alone for five minutes he was at work the whole time and afterward he spent the night with us too i sense some disquiet and call home my wife also tells me the situation is very tense be careful we finished the job at the site and i left for sumgait first thing on the morning of the th when we left the guys warned me they told me that i shouldn t tell anyone on the way that i was an armenian i took someone else s business travel documents in the name of zardali and hid my own i hid it and my passport in my socks we set out for baku our guys were on the bus they sat behind and i sat up front in baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case as it turns out they knew what was happening in sumgait i arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of sumgait is closed there is no way to get there that the city is closed off and the buses aren t running buses normally leave baku for sumgait almost every two minutes and suddenly no buses well we tried to get there via private drivers one man an azerbaijani said let s go find some other way to get there they found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to sumgait he took us there but the others had said i wouldn t go if you gave me a thousand rubles why because they re burning the city and killing the armenians there isn t an armenian left well i got hold of myself so i could still stand up so we squared it away the four of us got in the car and we set off for sumgait on the way the driver says in fact there aren t any armenians left they burned them all beat them all and stabbed them well i was silent the whole way odd miles i was silent the driver asks me how old are you old man he wants to know if i m being that quiet not saying anything maybe it means i m an armenian how old are you he asks me i say i m i m too but i call you old man i say it depends on god each person s life in this world is different i look much older than my years that s why he called me old man well after that he was silent too we re approaching the city i look and see tanks all around and a cordon before we get to the kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand well he was waving his hand we all start waving our hands i m sitting there with them i start waving my hand too i realized that this was a sign that meant there were no armenians with us i look at the city there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the street you know and there s no traffic well probably i was scared they stopped our car people were standing on the sidewalks they have armature shafts and stones and they stopped us along the way the driver tells us how they know who s an armenian and who s not the armenians usually for example i m an armenian but i speak their language very well well armenians usually pronounce the azeri word for nut or little nut as pundukh but fundukh is actually correct the pronunciations are different anyone who says pundukh even if they re not armenian they immediately take out and start to slash another one says there was a car there with five people inside it he says they started hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire and they didn t let the people out he says they wouldn t let them get out of the car i only saw the car but the driver says that he saw everything well he often drives from baku to sumgait and back when they stop us we all get out of the car i look and there s a short guy his eyes are gleaming he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one we re azerbaijani they tell him no armenians here he did come up to me when we were pulling our things out and says maybe you re an armenian old man but in azerbaijani i say you should be ashamed of yourself and he left turned and left that was all that happened what was i to do i had to the city was on fire but i had to steal my children out of my own home they stopped us at the entrance to mir street that s where the kavkaz store and three large story buildings are that s the beginning of down town i saw that burned automobile there completely burned only metal remained i couldn t figure out if it was a zhiguli or a zaporozhets later i was told it was a zhiguli and the people in there were completely incinerated nothing remained of them not even any traces that driver had told me about it and i saw the car myself the car was there the skeleton a metallic carcass about to yards from the kavkaz store i see a military transport an armored personnel carrier the hatches are closed and people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it the crowd is and i hear shots not automatic fire it s true but pistol shots several shots there were azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier someone in the crowd was shooting apparently they either wanted to kill the soldiers or get a machine gun or something at that point there was only one armored personnel carrier and all the tanks were outside the city cordoning off sumgait i walked on i see two azerbaijanis going home from the plant i can tell by their gait that they re not bandits they re just people walking home i joined them so in case something happened in case someone came up to us and asked questions either of us would be in a position to answer you see but i avoided the large groups because i m a local and might be quickly recognized i tried to keep at a distance and walked where there were fewer people well so i walked into microdistrict which is across from our block i can t get into our block but i walked where there were fewer people so as to get around well there i see a tall guy and to people are walking behind him and he s shouting into a megaphone comrades the armenian azerbaijani war has begun the police have megaphones like that so they re talking and walking around the second microdistrict i see that they re coming my way and turn off behind a building i noticed that they walked around the outside buildings and inside the microdistricts there were about or people standing on every corner and at the middles of the buildings and at the edges what they were doing i can t say because i couldn t get up close to them i was afraid but the most important thing was to get away from there to get home and at least find out if my children were alive or not april yerevan reference the sumgait tragedy pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan

writes vbv r d eeap cwru edu virgilio dean b velasco jr writes in article apr athos rutgers edu caralv caralv auto trol com carol alvin writes are all truths also absolutes is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes the answer to both questions is yes perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then to me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations etc true in every instance possible do you agree with this definition i think you do similarly all truth is absolute indeed a non absolute truth is a contradiction in terms when is something absolute when it is always true obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a contradiction in terms i agree with carol here determining absolutes is practically speaking a waste of time and we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relative for example i recently was asking some children the question what temperature does water boil at i got the answer degrees consistently i asked if they knew what scale and was told it s just degrees any scale that s what all thermometers say well that s sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong it is not an absolute truth similarly scripture is full of truth which we should nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point then religion easily becomes an intellectual head trip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism imo example of head covering in church deleted this was a good example there may be an absolute truth behind the writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the corinthians and not necessarily elsewhere the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth which was having a lot of trouble with order is it absolute truth to me no and i see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there are plenty of other examples can you reconcile this even the most die hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally i ve yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally the bible was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world such a statement is terribly self contradictory let me put it to you this way if there are no absolutes shouldn t we conclude that the statement there are no absolutes is not absolutely true obviously we have a contradiction here i don t claim that there are no absolutes i think there are very few though and determining absolutes is difficult i agree very few and even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference since i know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me there is hardly consensus even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation so people sometimes disagree about what is true this does not negate the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe i can t prove the existence of absolutes i can only rely upon my experience i also trust god s revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinite therefore we can t comprehend the absolutes so i don t need them i can never know the essence of god only the energies by and through which god is manifested to god s creation so the reality can be that there are absolutes but it is of no practical importance it s like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be swell who cares it doesn t affect me in any practical useful way i might as well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that they live on mars maybe god did so what is that going to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor or god whether or not i go to this or that cafeteria for lunch no this attitude leads many non christians to believe that all christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning christianity is true wonderful and sensible it appeals to reason since reason is an inner reflection of the logos of god explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world note i m not claiming there is no place for authority that d be silly there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that and is generally agressive good parents like god are authoritative many christians are simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few adults respond to

totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong assuming that they are using civilians for cover assuming also come on brad if we are going to get anywhere in this or any discussion it doesn t help to bring up elements i never addressed nor commented on in any way i made no comment on who is right or who is wrong only that civilians are being used as cover and that having been placed in between the israelis and the guerillas they will be injured as both parties continue their fight the purpose of an army s use of military uniforms is to set its members apart from the civilians so that civilians will not be thought of by the other side as combatants so what do you think is the meaning behind the intention and the effect when an army purposely does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to look like civilians they are judging that the benefit they will receive from this cover is more important that the harm that will come to civilians this is a comment on the israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas do have some responsibility in putting civilians in the middle of this fight by putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians barracks etc the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians but if the guerillas do this aren t they putting themselves at greater risk absolutely they ask themselves why set ourselves apart by wearing uniforms when there is a ready made cover for us civilians that makes sense from their point of view but when this cover is used the guerillas should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back getting even it doesn t make sense to shell the villages the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians i agree with you here i have always thought that israel s bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective but there is no reason that israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act there is every reason to believe that taking the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attacks as i said previously israel spent several decades sitting passively on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks after the attackers had entered israeli territory it didn t work very well the host arab state did little nothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti israel guerillas in residence if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks this is just another selectively applied statement the reason for this drawn out impasse between ababs palestinians and israelis is that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other by your criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations that is precisely why the palestinians in their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy are demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already they do not trust that israel will follow through the entire process and allow palestinians to reach full autonomy do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians if you do then why should israel s view of arabs palestinians be any different why should they trust the arab palestinians words since they don t they are very reluctant to give up tangible assets land control of areas in exchange for words for this reason they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached but don t you see that the same statement can be made both ways if lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy absolutely so are the arabs palestinians asking first for the israelis word in relation to any agreement no what is being demanded first is land when the issue is land and one party finally gets hold of this land what the other party does is totally irrelevent if i now have possession of this land your words have absolutely no power whether israel chooses to keeps its word does not get the land back afterall israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in lebanon during slg tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son while the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars have been removed the weapons needed to cross border attacks still remain to some extent rocket attacks still continue and commando raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life yours of that of others such attacks also continue of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn t make the lebanese so mad as to do that bat guano the situation you call for existed in the s and attacks were commonplace furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible there is no way these groups can be effectively disarmed unless the state is as authoritarian is syria s the only other way is for lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with israel essentially mirroring israel s border secirity on its side it has to prove to isreal that it is this committed to protecting israel from attack from lebanese territory once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria

take over lebanon i don t think israel or lebanon would like that what both sides need is to receive something tangible the arabs palestinians are looking for land and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to israel israel has two problems if it gives up real land it is exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation and that change doesn t help israel s position and when it

department of computer science new haven ct i told some friends of mine two weeks ago that koresh was dead the fbi and the batf could not let a man like that live he was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies now before everyone gets crazy with me let me say that koresh was crazy as a bed bug but out government was crazier and they lied to us they told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time yet whoever was watching the place failed to see that koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and wondered why they didn t pick him up then there are two possible answers first they didn t see him what kind of survaillance is that second they didn t care they wanted a confrontation they wanted publicity and they got it after the first battle they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming they also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that well we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige according to them they did but according to the hartford courant the woman that raised koresh his grandmother was not allowed to go in and see him the fbi agent who she spoke with was bob ricks and according to the paper he said a lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out his grandmother raised vernon howell koresh s real name she didn t raise david koresh someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level there is also an emotional level on which they can reach you here s another one all during this operation the fbi has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done now they claim they never thought he would do it i knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing that was the start of the justification part part of the plan that s when i knew it would come soon but back to the plan it is considered cruel and unusal punishment to execute criminals in the minds of many people but look at what s acceptable they knew the parents adults had gas masks they did not know or were not sure if the children had them so the plan was to pour the gas into the compound the mothers seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with i spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran i went through cbr chemical biological radiological warfare training part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to to make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical agent that irritates the skin you think its on fire i have no doubts the children would become hysterical its not the kind of thing you never want to do again this was the plan the final solution we waited days for our hostages to come home from iran we gave these people days i stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success well fbi agent ricks changed my mind again a newclip from the hartford courant and while expressing regret at the loss of life he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt it took dead children to get us that new definition of success one more thought the government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises he had a license for the caliber machine gun they knew damn well he had one they also knew he had it legally still without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him for all of this my president takes full responsibility what a guy i hope he gets it in article exuptr exu ericsson se exuptr exu ericsson se patrick

solntze wpd sgi com jon livesey writes much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself this is probably the wrong group for it the only relevance here is that you don t seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment actually is and when it is murder that is when you tell us murder is wrong you are using a term you have not yet defined well i ve said that when an innocent person has been executed this is objectively a murder however who is at blame is another question it seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risks is to blame there is a probability of killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air and there is a probability of killing an innocent person when the state administers a system of capital punishment so when you do either you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or later result in the killing of an innocent person yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this and driving will kill people as will airlines but people continue to do both driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling prisoners by courts they are risks that we take upon ourselves willingly and i argue that our law system is a similar risk perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this in fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents if our own driving kills someone else then sure there is a moral issue i know at least one person who was involved in a fatal accident and they felt vey guilty afterwards but such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals on the road again the blame is on society no i m not this is what you said you were saying that if there were such a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed it would still be the fault of the state since it did the actual killing no i just commented that the state does the killing it does not depend on there being false witnesses how could it the state does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes yes but the state is not at fault in such a case the state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses it is possible so what are you trying to say that capital punishment is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating the system i m saying capital punishment is murder period not because of this that and the other but because it involves taking human life that s my definition of murder i make no appeals to dictionaries or to objective morals okay so this is what you call murder but the question is whether or not all such murders are wrong are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the circumstances if we as a society decide to murder someone then we should say that and lists our reasons for doing so and live with the moral consequences we should not play word games and pretend that murder isn t murder and that s my opinion about how society ought to be run but this is basically how it works society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution and every member of society shares this blame and most people s definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it but we were trying to discuss an objective moral system or at least its possibilty what ramifications does your personal system have on an objective one no we were not discussing an objective moral system i was showing you that you didn t have one because for one thing you were incapable of defining the terms in it for example murder murder violates the golden rule executions do not because by allowing it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is we re not talking about reading minds we are just talking about knowing the truth yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court systems work on a principle of knowing the truth beyond a reasonable doubt sorry but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately here is what you said and since we are looking totally objectively at this case then we know what people are thinking when they are voting to execute the person or not if the intent is malicious and unfair then the execution would be murder what you are doing now is to slide into another claim which is quite different the jury being persuaded beyond a serious doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond a serious doubt reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not but in an objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth that is twelve members must be convinced of a truth moreover a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence that you and i would laugh at but then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the conviction was unfair but would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds if we assume that it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute truth it s not a question of fairness your claim which i have quoted above is a claim about whether we can know it was fair so as to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we can t always determine the difference in our flawed system i think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isn t objectively perfect you see it doesn t matter if we know it is fair or not objectively it is either fair or it is not now there s a huge difference if we can read minds we can know and if we cannot read minds we can know nothing the difference is not in degree of fairness but in what we can know but what we know has no effect on an objective system i think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system if we are clear on which goals it is supposed to promote i m not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that i am pretty sure does not exist why are you so sure i simply want people to confront reality my reality remember why is your reality important in this case the reality is that ideal theories apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice system for every innocent person released from death row there may have been a dozen innocent people executed or a hundred or none at all we simply don t know but we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system now what are we going to do on the one hand we can pretend that we have an ideal theory and that we can know things we can never know and the justie system is fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder and go on our way well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal we can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible on the other hand we can recognize that all justice has a small we hope probability of punishing the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequences of the systems we set up and then say well here we go murdering again maybe some of us will even say gee i wonder if all this is strictly necessary yes we all bear the responsibility most people seem willing to do this i think that the second is preferable in that if requires people to face the moral consequences of what we do as a society instead of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word games we must realize the consequences of all our actions why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack and lest i forget i also don t think we have an objective moral system and i believe i only have to take that idea seriously when someone presents evidence of it i don t think our country has an objective system but i think such an objective system can exist in theory without omniscience an objective system is not possible in practice keith',\n",

see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit you will either find this in the rm file for the image or series of

and i ll get in contact with the artist for you or give you their contact information when you do use permitted work it s always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files naming images please keep the names of your files in dos format that means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number thus leonardo devinci s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like ldmek gif or ldmek jpg or ldmech gif etc keeping the names under characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems creating image files when creating image files be sure to

       " 'from ejalbert husc harvard edu subject re monophysites and mike walker organization harvard university science center lines in article may geneva rutgers edu db n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler writes mike walker if you are using the standard formula of fully god and fully human that i m not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human i think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity it s a consequence of the fall jesus is human but not a fallen human clh i differ with our moderator on this i thought the whole idea of god coming down to earth to live as one of us subject to sin and death as one of the consecration prayers in the book of common prayer puts it was that jesus was tempted but did not succumb if sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity then jesus fully human nicea would not be subject to sin but then the resurrection loses some of its meaning because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin to distinguish between human and fallen human makes jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it s often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology i don t think there s any question that there is a problem with nestorius and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical but i d like to be a bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought more moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox e g theodore of mopsuestia my impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition not just nestorius version and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox clh first the monophysites inherited none of nestorius s version they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him second the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to nestorius were not as extreme as his successful opponents who wrote the conventional history claimed mainly nestorius opposed the term theotokos for mary arguing i think correctly that a human could not be called mother of god i mean in the athanasian creed we talk about the son uncreate surely even arians would concede that jesus existed long before mary anyway nestorius s opponents claimed that by saying mary was not theotokos that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of jesus which would require two seperate and distinct natures the argument fails though because mary simply gave birth to jesus who preexisted her either divinely if you accept nestorianism as commonly defined or both natures intertwined a la chalcedon second i am not sure that nestorianism is not a better alternative than the orthodox view after all i find it hard to believe that pre incarnation that jesus s human nature was in heaven likewise post ascension i think rather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him it was a seperate nature capable of being tempted as in gethsemane since i believe the divine nature could never be tempted but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed comments on the above warmly appreciated jason albert there may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin the original complaint was from someone who didn t see how we could call jesus fully human because he didn t sin i completely agree that jesus was subject to temptation i simply object to the idea that by not succumbing he is thereby not fully human i believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human i again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism i agree with you and have said elsewhere that there s reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical there are scholars who maintain that nestorius was not nestorian i have to confess that the first time i read some of the correspondence between nestorius and his opponents i thought he got the better of them however most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to chalcedon was an advance and that nestorius was at the very least rash and dogmatic as the editor of the christological controversy refers to him in rejecting all approaches other than his own as regular usenet readers know narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong furthermore he did say some things that i think are problematical he responds to a rather mild letter from cyril with a flame worthy of usenet in it he says to attribute also to the logos in the name of the incarnation the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him is my brother either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius and apollinaris and the others those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound because of it to make the divine logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness these things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood it s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity but the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have to some degree a part in being born growing up and dying of course it must be

theorem organization program of computer graphics in article ncsmith ndsuvax uucp timothy lyle smith writes i need to find a formula algorithm to determine if a line intersects a polygon i would prefer a method that would do this in as little time as possible i need this for use in a forward raytracing program i think that this is a very difficult problem to start with lines and polygons are semi algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points here are a few off the cuff ideas first we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated now the jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open and thus non compact regions thus the line lies completely inside the polygon the line lies completely outside the polygon or possibly but this will rarely happen the line intersects the polyon now the phrasing of this question says if a line intersects a polygon so this is a decision problem one possibility the decision model approach is to reduce the question to some other well known problem q and then try to solve q an answer to q gives an answer to the original decision problem in recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called postscript see postscript language by adobe systems incorporated isbn co so given a line l and a polygon p we can write a postscript program that draws the line l and the polygon p and then outputs the answer by output we mean the program executes a command called showpage which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon a quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q and thus the original problem there are two small problems with this approach there is an infinite number of ways to encode l and p into the reduced problem q so we will be forced to invoke the axiom of choice or equivalently zorn s lemma but the use of the axiom of choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days more importantly the question arises as to whether or not the postscript program q will actually output a piece of paper or in other words will it halt now postscript is expressive enough to encode everything that a turing machine might do thus the halting problem for postscript is undecidable it is quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable i won t even begin to go into other difficulties such as aliasing finite precision and running out of ink paper or both a couple of references might be principia mathematica newton i

gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used snort ah there go my sinuses again for example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always gives oh wow a classic textbook hey they laughed at einstein too before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as nizoral to his new patients if they ve been on braod spectrum anti biotics or more times in the last two years he s kept a record of the results and for over patients found that over of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for his program yeah i ll bet tomorrow the world listen uncontrolled studies like this are worthless in my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classic symptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book e g extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which i never had before started in november within one week of full dosage of sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes i m also greatly improved in other areas as well i m sure you are you sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac who responds to miracle cures of course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriously snort also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people yeah it sounds reasonable to me of course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i was from over years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc oh really what tests immune compromised my ass more like credulous malingerer this is a psychiatric syndrome can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there s no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasons you know it s a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way it s ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic the trouble is that it isn t toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks btw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect you ll find a lot of people who are on nystatin all the time the only good thing about nystatin is that it s relatively cheap and when taken orally non toxic but oral nystatin is without any systemic effect so unless it were given iv it would be without any effect on your sinuses i wish these quacks would first use iv nystatin or amphotericin b on people like you that would solve the yeast problem once and for all in summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven t been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i cannot guarantee their safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as i am concerned perhaps a little haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating your symptoms are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket i d hate to think my insurance premiums are going towards this steve dyer dyer you re rude medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour it s often practiced in a disorganized manner most early treatment of non life threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient it s an educated guess by a trained person but it s still no more than a guess it s cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don t respond there are diseases that haven t been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren t known read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them after scientific methods have run out then it s the patient s freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose and it s well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn t have all the answers this person said that they had relief by taking the medicine maybe it s a miracle cure maybe it s valid how do you know you might argue with the reasoning

keywords dan bissell bissda saturn wwc edu dan lawrence bissell writes first i want to start right out and say that i m a christian it makes sense to be one have any of you read tony campollo s book liar lunatic or the real thing i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself i assume you are posting to encourage comments how much history has tony campello read not much it seems the arguements he uses i am summing up the book is about whether jesus was god or not i know many of you don t believe but listen to a different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what others have to say it is good to hear that there are a few reasonable christians about if only those christian scientists would take note in australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics for example there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is years old and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been accounted for the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people did tony follow that one up some reasons why he wouldn t be a liar are as follows who would die for a lie wouldn t people be able to tell if he was a liar people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed millions of people have died for a lie this point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments work in that way but consider the many aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the spanish invaders the list is endless the aztecs lost btw call me a fool but i believe he did heal people that is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me or anyone to become a christian more to the point it does not add weight to the claim that jesus was the real thing niether was he a lunatic would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy very doubtful in fact rediculous for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of nazi germany more to the point did tony mention this one could hardly call werner heisenberg and his many colleagues fools or illogical men their support of hitler was based i presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles obviously my argument is invalid if tony thought that hitler was sane therefore since he wasn t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing hmmm i don t think his arguments warrant the use of a therefore some other things to note he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in hrs alone this in his betrayal and crucifixion i don t have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it this is unfortunately what alot of religious discussions i have had with people result in quoting the bible the only reasonable way i think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present if someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sorts of shit tony s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone who thinks the bible is total fiction that jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless for example in mathematics you cannot say a is equal to b because a is equal to b i don t think most people understand what a christian is that would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god s sake he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same hey we can t do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him that s tuff and most people don t want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time we don t rush it in one day christianity is your whole life it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while we box everything into time units such as work at this time sports tv social life god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves i think if you posted this part to alt religion you would get more flames than here i have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people someone famous said that there two evils in life polititians and churchs one rules by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead if i am pressed i could probably find

think otherwise see the spreading christianity thread in which he says i ignore certain statements that i specifically acknowledged and dean did not he called them the great commission but this is not descriptive of jesus s words in matt matt jerusalem bible translation and if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have to say as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust from your feet matt i tell you solemnly on the day of judgment it will not go as hard with the land of sodom and gomorrah as with that town in the post to which dean is referring above i said the above is a good description of kaflowitz who keeps harping on shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what christ said next the highlighted words refer to matt and respectively and dean countered actually this comment of your s is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are since i specifically acknowledged the great commission and the entreaty to spread the word in fact it is the combination of the two statements i was addressing and not just the one and for you to characterize that as ignoring the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are of course matt quoted above makes no mention of instruction to spread the word all these quotes btw are from message id apr cbnewsj cb att com in which at the end he claims i did not answer a question which i answered and which he deleted to get the chronology right he deleted the answer and then said i didn t answer and i claim it correctly because my question went do you too measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood and the closest dean came to an answer was peter peter peter you re just so stupid pretentious dull and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is of course this does not answer my question which has to do with posts in general and not my posts in particular surely even dean knows this yet he brazenly asserts otherwise reinforcing his claim with an insult so i now restore the answer to your question that you deleted if you re still unable to figure it out ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you it really doesn t take much sophistication to understand on top of which i doubt that the answer is at all representative of dean s true frame of mind the insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of dean s mind throughout the line post from which these quotes were taken one wonders whether dean s mind is so warped as to find sport in all this he even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread you made an ass of yourself by claiming that it was in the tradition of lent to make public announcements of the sins of other individuals false i said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one s sins that i made public announcements of the sins of others sins btw that were a matter of public record documented in the posts of others is a different matter many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins so i pointed some of them out and i expressly set up a whole thread your turn to let people point out my sins to me dean again you made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to paint jews as plaster saints thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about jews and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made and then claiming i am ignoring the very argument i acknowledge actually what happened was that dean made it seem like any jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to jewish customs in doing so he was caricaturing jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding as well as implicitly slandering all jews who make public their acts of charity i went very easily on dean for this giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about plaster saints suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording in an astonishing act of ingratitude dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us and using it as the basis of one insult after another peter nyikos',\n",

scanners when initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options text graphics input source ie scanner fax file disk file automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document i would like scanned and in what order once an image is scanned you can bring up the pop up image verification the software gives you two errors at this point blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built in dictionary yellow shade which are words that wordscan plus doesn t think it converted correctly at all i have found that the software should give itself more credit it is usually correct instead of wrong if a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about words i find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary after a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate tiff or pcx file format i was extremely impressed

infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early s the u s public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes e g escherichia coli o h hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings e g hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the u s health care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs this issue of mmwr introduces a new series emerging infectious diseases

editorial note e coli o h is a pathogenic gram negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated preliminary data from a cdc year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli o h that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of participating hospitals and was isolated from of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli o h often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after days but of patients develop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e coli o h in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli o h using smac agar when infections with e coli o h are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases e coli o h lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the u s department of agriculture s food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e coli o h entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to f c fda personal communication regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e coli o h and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e coli o h references cdc preliminary report foodborne

crypt sci answers and news answers every days contents what is the national security agency nsa what are the us export regulations what is tempest what are the beale ciphers and are they a hoax what is the american cryptogram association and how do i get in touch is rsa patented what about the voynich manuscript what is the national security agency nsa the nsa is the official security body of the u s government it was given its charter by president truman in the late s and has continued research in cryptology till the present the nsa is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world governments in general have always been prime employers of cryptologists the nsa probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice but for reasons of national security almost all information about the nsa is classified bamford s book bamfd gives a history of the people and operations of the nsa the following quote from massey mas highlights the difference between public and private research in cryptography if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed doors without doubt the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in cryptology for only about years has there in fact been widespread open research in cryptology there have been and will continue to be conflicts between these two research communities open research is common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly journals but can a government agency charged with responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government s code breakers one might argue that publication of a provably secure cipher would force all governments to behave like stimson s gentlemen but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most scientific fields the wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology but rather that these conflicts at least those of which we are aware have been so few and so mild what are the us export regulations in a nutshell there are two government agencies which control export of encryption software one is the bureau of export administration bxa in the department of commerce authorized by the export administration regulations ear another is the office of defense trade controls dtc in the state department authorized by the international traffic in arms regulations itar as a rule of thumb bxa which works with cocom has less stringent requirements but dtc which takes orders from nsa wants to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa the newsgroup misc legal computing carries many interesting discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export what people think about those laws and many other complex issues which go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci crypt make sure to consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in jail if you are lucky your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at least heard of the itar what is tempest tempest is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer equipment it was created in response to the discovery that information can be read from computer radiation e g from a crt at quite a distance and with little effort needless to say encryption doesn t do much good if the cleartext is available this way what are the beale ciphers and are they a hoax thanks to jim gillogly for this information and john king for corrections the story in a pamphlet by j b ward goes thomas jefferson beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass of treasure and buried it in bedford county virginia leaving three ciphers with an innkeeper the ciphers describe the location contents and intended beneficiaries of the treasure ward gives a decryption of the second cipher contents called b it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the declaration of independence doi as key b and b are unsolved many documents have been tried as the key to b aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve b by various means with an eye toward splitting the treasure the beale cypher association p o box beaver falls pa you can get the ciphers from the rec puzzles faql by including the line send index in a message to netlib peregrine com and following the directions there are apparently several different versions of the cipher floating around the correct version is based on the pamphlet says john king kingj hpcc corp hp com some believe the story is a hoax kruh kru gives a long list of problems with the story gillogly gil decrypted b with the doi and found some unexpected strings including abfdefghiijklmmnohpp hammer president of the beale cypher association agrees that this string couldn t appear by chance but feels there must be an explanation gwyn sci crypt expert is unimpressed with this string what is the american cryptogram association and how do i get in touch the aca is

is probably the longest of my entire collection so that the prophecy be fulfilled in considering the christian religion and judging it according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier jewish prophecy the scribe matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of jesus of nazareth as you will see matthew s main strategy is to take various old testament passages often not even about the promised messiah and apply them to the circumstances in the new testament we must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts since the gospels were written at least years after jesus was executed we do not know how much happened exactly as stated but for purposes of analysis we will take particular claims at face value immanuel we begin of course at the beginning mt mary will bear a son and you joseph will name him jesus which means g d is salvation for he will save his people from their sins all this happened to fulfil what the lord had spoken by a prophet isaiah in the days of ahaz c bce king of judah rezin of syria and pekah of israel made war on jerusalem capitol of judah but could not quite conquer it when the house of david i e ahaz and his court in judah were told of this its heart and the heart of its people shook and the lord g d said to isaiah go to meet with ahaz and the lord spoke to ahaz through prophet isaiah naturally saying ask a sign of g d your lord it can be as deep as sheol or as high as heaven but ahaz said i won t ask i will not put the lord to a test then isaiah said hear then o house of david is it not enough for you to weary men that you must weary my god too therefore the lord himself will give you a sign behold a young woman is with child and will bear a son and name him immanuel which means g d is with us he will eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil and choose good for before the child knows how to refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings you dread will have been deserted matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics further he the hebrew word almah young woman as specifically virgin but this is not a prophecy about the messiah it is not a prophecy about an event to happen years later it is not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother in short it not about jesus matthew has made use of a verse out of context and tries to make it fit the specific case of mary it should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be made to fit mary mary virgin or not was indeed a young woman with child of course the fit is shady and has problems jesus while thought of by later christians to be g d walking among men was never called by the name immanuel if christianity wished to claim this prophecy for jesus it becomes at best a cut and paste prophecy a second class prophecy not too convincing egypt after jesus s birth in bethlehem matthew tells about a quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to egypt as if he wishes to liken jesus to moses this was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king herod mt and remained there until the death of herod this was to fulfil what the lord had spoken out of egypt i have cal led my son what the lord really said was this hosea when israel was a child i loved him and out of egypt i called my son the more i called them my people the more they went from me they kept sacrificing to the ba als and kept burning incense to idols matthew conveniently omits the rest of hosea s oracle but it was indeed israel that once called out of egypt wanted to return this is history jesus is certainly not being spoken of here and if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a jesus that flees and resists g d again this prophecy is just not as convincing as matthew probably had hoped rachel weeps while jesus is off vacationing in egypt matthew says that king herod sought to kill him and thus ordered the executions of all young male children matthew then writes mt by this that which was spoken by the prophet jeremiah was fulfilled a voice was heard in ramah wailing and loud lamentation rachel weeping for her children she refused to be consoled because they were no more the reference is to a passage in jeremiah referring to the carrying off of israel into exile by sargon of assyria in bce rachel the ancestor of the major tribes of israel ephraim and manasseh is said to weep for her descendants who are no more it is metaphorical of course since rachel lived and dies before the hebrews were even in the egyptian exile it is interesting to note that it was leah not rachel who was the ancestor of the judeans the land where jesus and bethlehem were if anyone should do weeping for her children it is leah the only connexion that rachel has with bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city on the way to ephrath bethlehem as for herod and his infanticide it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred one never knows but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the bible nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time herod was particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil deeds of herod were carefully recorded this might be a prime example of how events were added to jesus s life to enhance the message of the church s gospel because of the whole story s similarity to the tale of the infant moses in egypt it is highly likely that it is a device set up by matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of jesus it is not surprising that matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the jeremiah quote the children the prophet speaks of are not dead but exiled in the assyrian empire g d comforts the weeping rachel saying that the children will be returned he will gather them back together of course this would not suit matthew s purpose as the children he speaks of are dead for good again the prophecy matthew sets up is not even that and to anyone who bothers to check it out is not too convincing the nazarene we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another matthean prophecy after leaving egypt joseph wife take the infant jesus to live in the city of nazareth mt that what was spoken of by the prophets might be fulfilled he shall be called a nazarene first thing we notice is that matthew does not mention the name of the prophet s this time second we have to ask who he is there are no messianic prophecies speaking of a nazarene worse there are no prophecies period mentioning a nazarene still worse there are no nazarenes mentioned in the old testament at all in the book of judges an angel tells samson s mother that she will judges conceive and bear a son no razor shall tough his head for he will be a nazirite to his god from the day of his birth he will deliver israel from the hands of the philistines this is of course not a prophecy of jesus or the messiah of g d but it is the best that can be found obviously matthew has begun to go overboard in cut and paste prophecies in that he is simple making them up now bearing our diseases jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities mt this was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet isaiah he took our infirmities and bore our diseases as expected the verse quoted in isaiah is quoted out of context and a few words are skewed to fit the christian scheme we have is surely he the suffering servant has borne our sickness and carried our pains from a reading of the surrounding passages in isaiah we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of israel jehovah s chosen servant and people he speaks to the israelites suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it this image is deeply ingrained in jewish identity an image of a chastised yet cherished israel as the instrument of the nations salvation by g d the verses speak of israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline they do not speak of a servant going around and healing people notice that the servant in isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations and individual jews jesus as we all know did not take the diseases onto himself the verses here in isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that had already happened while it is believed that jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bear the illnesses he healed so while someone might want to say that figuratively jesus reenacted the deeds of israel in his spiritual atonement he has to admit that matthew s parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect silent messiah upon healing multitudes of commoners it is said that jesus ordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldn t arouse the attention of the local rulers mt this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet isaiah behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved with whom my soul is pleased i will put my spirit on him and he will announce justice to the gentiles he will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory and the gentiles will hope in his name the isaiah passage quoted reads is behold my servant whom i uphold my chosen in whom my soul delights i have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the nations we will not cry or lift up his voice or make it heard in the street he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick he will faithfully bring forth justice he will not fail burn dimly or be discouraged bruised until he has established justice in the earth and the coastlands await his law you see matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage because it does not suit the dealings of jesus christians could never think of jesus failing never would the light of mankind burn dimly but the servant nation of israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done when the gentiles come to embrace g d there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will be the children of g d also the ending phrase has been changed from the judaic the coastlands await his law to the christologic the gentiles will hope in his name while the original proclaims the torah law of jehovah the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name if one has any doubt the servant referred to is not jesus one has only to read the whole chapter isaiah and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant a people robbed and plundered so we see that when matthew s attempt at prophecy is examined it crumbles three days and three nights now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god jesus himself he speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection mt for as jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights before any further discussion can occur it is necessary to know how the jews understood days as far as day names went each was hours long lasting from sunset pm to the following sunset pm what was referred to as a day was the period of light from am to the ending sunset at pm thus according to our time scale a sabbath day began at pm friday evening and lasted until pm saturday evening this is why the jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of saturdays instead of sundays it seems like a real miracle that christians didn t forget that saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week thus when days and nights are referred to together hour daylight portions and hour night periods are being spoken of thus jesus says that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights as the good book tells us jesus was crucified on the ninth hour which is pm friday afternoon he then was put into the grave sometime after that then jesus left the grave rose before dawn of what we call sunday the dawn after the sabbath was over what this means is that jesus was using our time for clarity in the grave from pm friday night to some time before am sunday morning we could also add a little time before pm friday since the bible is not specific here what this means using jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day two nights and possibly a couple of hours of one day certainly this is a problem for jesus prediction there is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights even using modern time measurements we then are led to suspect that this error is another one of matthew s little mistakes and that the gospel writer put false words into his god s mouth and no matter who made the prediction it is more than unconvincing it is counter convincing hearing understanding jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables stories in which a deeper meaning could be found if you were already one of the elect those chosen to understand the message of jesus he reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants if the people cannot understand them there is no need to bother with them since they will not accept the plain message any better matthew says mt with them the audience indeed in fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which says you will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive because this people s heart has grown dull their ears are heavy of hearing and they have shut their eyes so the they would not perceive with them her with their ears and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them the original isaiah passages are part of his earlier works his call to the ministry this is in bce when israel is flourishing right before it falls under the authority of assyria isaiah sees the good times ending and also a vision from g d calling him to bring reform to israel and judah is and g d said go and say to this people hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not perceive make the heart of this people fat make their ears heavy and shut their eyes so they will not see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn and be healed then isaiah said how long lord and he said until the cities lie waste without inhabitant and houses without men and the land is utterly desolate and the g ds take men far away and forsaken places are many in the land and though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stands when the tree is felled the holy seed is its stump here we see that it is really g d who causes the people of israel to stop listening to the prophet s warnings but reaffirms the promise made to solomon s and david s seed lineage if you read the rest of isaiah you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of g d to use israel as a servant a light to the nations look at isaiah we see that matthew has cut and pasted just a little portion of isaiah s verse to suit his own gospel needs more than that he has altered the words to make it fit the people who didn t understand jesus s stories and as we see isaiah s verses are not prophecies but rather commands from g d to him in the present once again matthew s prophecy falls flat on its face matthew tries again to make jesus s parables look like they have the prophetic approval mt he said nothing to them without a parable this was to fulfil what was spoken of by the prophet i will open my mouth to them in parables i will utter that which has been hidden since the foundation of the world matthew really botches up here he attempts to quote not from a prophet but from the psalms ps i will open my mouth in parable i will utter dark sayings of old things that we all have heard and known things that our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the lord as was pointed out the verses in the psalms do not really come from a prophet you might also want to know that earlier copies of matthew s gospel even inserted isaiah s name as this prophet apparently later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up perhaps the most significant part of this is that once again matthew has altered the old testament scriptures as jesus has said earlier he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them the parables in the psalms are not to be hidden further they speak of things known that our fathers have told us jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of the world indeed jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion this is in direct opposition to the parables in the psalms no wonder matthew had to rewrite them and still once again matthew s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face but christians rarely look at this matthew s prophecies aren t the only things about christianity that are beginning to look bad excuses of little faith in mt we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons except in one case not knowing what epilepsy was the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons it is no wonder that the disciples were unable to dispossess the epileptic but jesus perhaps no more enlightened than they is reported to have rebuked them saying they didn t have enough faith this seems strange why was this demon special it seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not apparently enough faith will allow someone to move mountains of course you will find no one these days that can move real mountains no one parts seas the only miracles the charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to mexico or some faraway place major miracles are making some old woman s arthritis feel better on sunday morning t v and the gods including jesus are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts they are either dead sleeping or hiding in heaven with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone yet life goes on tales of mystics stories of miracles all in a distant time or a distant place gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days jehovah too but now they are silent all the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don t get to see god anymore we re too lazy we re not zealous enough we re sinful it s just his plan we put too many of our own demands on g d s appearance if we had the right faith if we were willing to meet g d on his terms yet even the most pious of men have not seen g d you dear reader have not seen g d not literally you know that to be true i know that s presumptuous and bold but searching your heart you know what i mean all that we ve seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing g d they say our little faith does not merit us to see g d sometimes they say see the love in these people you worship with see the lives of people change that is seeing g d thus people get lulled to sleep satisfied with turning g d into the everyday sights but that is not seeing g d as i am speaking of it is not seeing g d the way people used to see what we see in the world that is good is the compassion of human hearts the love given and taken by men and women the forgiveness practised by christian atheist alike beauty created by the mind of man these are the things that are done these are what we see but it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith jesus rides on an ass shortly after accepting the role of the jewish messiah king jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into jerusalem mt this took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet saying tell the daughter of zion behold your king is coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a ass colt of course the passage quoted from zechariah reads a little differently lo your king comes to you he is triumphant and victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass colt he will command peace to the nations there isn t all that much difference here except that zechariah only involves one animal an ass colt while matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently thus he has jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass from matthew s version we get a comical picture of the divine christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys this could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma we find that in the account written earlier by st mark only the colt was called for and brought to jesus this indeed fits the verses of zechariah properly and shows us that in matthew attempt to use prophetic verses he has bungled now excluding many respectable christians i have met i have noticed that while christ is thought to have ridden on asses the situation is often reversed nowadays then entering the jerusalem temple the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling jesus the messiah but jesus replied as we might expect matthew to have done mt haven t you read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise it is more likely that matthew made this response up since jesus was never one to point out such little prophetic things and since as we might expect the quote is in error which seems to fit matthew s track record quite well we might ask jesus or matthew haven t you read for the source reads psalms o yahweh our lord how majestic is your name in the whole world you whose glory is chanted above the heavens by babes and infants you have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the enemy and the avenger the passages hardly need comment there is no perfect praise spoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to g d not his messiah king and not jesus as mentioned it seems to be just one more case of matthew s pen making up convenient prophetic scripture yhvh said to my lord jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised jewish messiah king is to be descended the jews agree it is king david but then jesus counters by quoting psalms the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet taken at face value jesus is denying the necessity of davidic descent one assumes he is in opposition to their answer of course the christian answer is that he agrees but is trying to make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah king it s tempting to believe this if one is a christian and not interested in matters of investigation but there are problems in jesus s time the psalm was thought to be about the messiah and it is easy to see why david might refer to the messiah as his superior we need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king bringing the jews to times even better than those under david s rule of course the jews listening had no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as the christians worship the problem lies in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several jews of jesus s time had also made one must remember that there were various factions among the jews often as a result of different expectations of the messiah king jesus was apparently one of these adventists like his audience who thought the messiah s advent was imminent and who interpreted psalms among others as being messianic what is the problem then psalm literally reads yhvh s utterance to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool yhvh sends forth your mighty scepter from zion rule in the midst of your foes your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy mountains you are a priest of the order of melchizedek forever the word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord but in the hebrew the word is adoni and no capitalisation exists adoni simply means lord a generic term as we would use it it is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to g d it is merely an address of respect there is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah king that this is supposed to be written by david is not certain the title of the psalm translates to either a psalm of david or a psalm about david it seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet about david s covenant and endorsement from g d if the psalm had been written by david it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah the idea of a perfect king descended from david was not present in david s age we have extensive tales of david s doings and sayings none of which include any praises of a messiah many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after david was dead in times of the exile when g d had put his show of favour for david s kingdom on hold the description in the psalm fit david very well david was promised by g d a rise to power victory over his enemies successful judgement among the nations he conquered he achieved the priesthood common to melchizedek in being a righteous king enabled to bless the people it all fits we do not have to blame this problem on matthew alone though here there is not artificial prophecy alluded to though his use of the scripture is rather questionable still this event is common to the other gospels too so we let matthew off a little more easily this time it is interesting to note though how matthew dresses up the event the earlier gospel of mark tells the tale with jesus simply speaking to a crowd matthew has the pharisees who became the religious competition of an infant christianity be the target of jesus s question as we might expect matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the pharisees such power is the pen moses jesus had it together all along we leave the gospel story of matthew momentarily to see a pseudo prophecy in john s gospel the gospel story of john deserves special treatment because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of jesus s career as told by even matthew but for the moment we will just look at one verse the early church leaders founded a religion on the jewish hopes of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by g d when constructing the history of abraham moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the jewish people while this was accomplished eventually under the rule of king david the christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise but to do so they expanded on the promise preaching about a heavenly kingdom john j c speaking your father abraham rejoiced to see my day he say it and was glad it would be nice to tie in approval for jesus from abraham but abraham knew nothing of jesus or a messiah or anything christian i have tried and failed to find any event in the old testament which corresponds to john s little prophecy it is par for the course to see st john making up old testament backings just like his forerunner matthew many christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud and it is surprising they still cling to it the potter s field we are told that jesus was betrayed while in jerusalem by one of his followers judas iscariot matthew writes mt and throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple judas departed but the chief priests taking the silver said it isn t lawful for us to put it in the treasury since it is blood money so they bought a potter s field with it to bury strangers in then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet jeremiah and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of israel and they gave them for the potter s field as the lord directed me this prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of old testament scripture first matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet it is zechariah who utters the verses which matthew makes use of zech and they weighed out my wages thirty shekels of silver then yhvh said to me cast them to the treasury the lordly price at which i was paid off by them so i took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of yhvh first of all the verses of zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of g d the deal with a shepherd most likely a priest chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before g d would send judah and israel into conflict with one another the word treasury had been replaced by the king james scholars with to the potter precisely because this made matthew s quote fit better but this is a blatant error the correct translation of the hebrew is indeed treasury which also makes perfect sense in zechariah s context whereas potter s field is totally unrelated whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation however given matthew s track record one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty of course matthew would have ample reason for altering the text the thirty pieces of silver match judas s situation and if as most christians seem to be the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity matthew might have another prophecy to toss around however the correct translation of zechariah directly contradicts the situation with judas and the high priests the high priests would not put the money in the treasury the worthless shepherd of zechariah does exactly the opposite of course to the average thursday night bible student the prophecy as presented by matthew would be taken at new testament face value to those matthew s work is convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots then jesus is led away to be crucified mt they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall but when he tasted it he would not drink it and when they had crucified him they divided his garments among them by casting lots that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots first of all the vinegar offered to jesus is actually common sour wine of the type that roman soldiers drank regularly we find that right before jesus dies the soldiers themselves give him some to drink not polluted with gall jn jesus said i thirst a bowl of vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth when he had received the vinegar he said it is finished but matthew seems to be drawing on not a passage from the prophets but one from the psalms ps i looked for pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none they gave me poison for food lit they put gall in my meat and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink add to them punishment upon punishment may they have no acquittal from thee let them be blotted out of the book of the living of course the sour wine offered to jesus is done at his request of drink this does indeed seem to be a show of pity the psalm quoted is about david and his political and military enemies it is not about the messiah or jesus it is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the jesus in the psalm asks g d for the damnation of the crucifiers whereas the jesus of the gospels says lk jesus said father forgive them the don t know what they do further matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall a bitter substance put into jesus s drink not his meat as the psalm stipulates with the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask what of the casting of lots this brings up the nd psalm which deserves discussion all by itself suffice it now to say that the fact that jesus s clothes were divided as told is no great thing it turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days as we will soon see it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to jesus it does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of jesus s clothes for a man so removed from worldly possessions his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions the nd psalm this psalm is attributed to david as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies it becomes a song of praise to yhvh and of hope taken out of context parts of it seem to fit the plight of jesus at the crucifixion quite well we will examine the primary passages verse my god my god why have you forsaken me why are you so far from helping me far from the words of my groaning oh my god i cry by day but you don t answer and by night but find no rest jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross this suggests that the whole psalm is really about jesus rather than king david of course the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to jesus or his execution jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the lamb led mute before its shearers indeed jesus doesn t do much groaning even when on the cross he certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross but i am a worm and no man scorned by men all who see me mock at me they make faces and wag their heads he committed his cause to yhvh so let him deliver him for he delights in him this seems to fit jesus s execution pretty well with the exception of the holy messiah being called a worm many bulls encompass me they open their mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encir cle me they have pierced my hands and feet i can see all my bones they divide my garments among them and cast lost for my raiment but you yhvh be not far away deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull it would seem quite convincing and i m sure the early christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too unfortunately this prophecy has a fatal flaw the words have pierced really do not exist in the psalm the correct hebrew translation is yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my hands and feet in hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character the word in the hebrew text is literally like the lion ka ari which makes sense in the context and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer it is convenience that would urge a christian to change the word to ka aru but to add the needed yet artificial weight to the prophecy this is just what the christian translators have chosen to do while the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to jesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators apart from the erroneous verse the psalm does not lend itself to jesus so easily verse speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross this naturally fits the psalm s true subject king david as a side note we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but rather the forearms this doesn t say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms but then facts aren t bound by our religious beliefs matthew escapes culpability this time as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord jesus but the psalm like many others was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of jesus s life and death how much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for christian theology it is easy to see for those who are not faithful fundamentalists how some of the events in the new testament might have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager matthew but it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims so far this has not said good things for st matthew the reference to the piercing looks a lot like jesus s crucifixion john s gospel recount written about years after the fact tells us at jesus s execution jn but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and out came blood and water these things took place that scripture be fulfilled the will look on him whom they ve pierced of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context prophet zechariah tells us how much of the nation of israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with them zc and yhvh will give victory to judah and on that day i will seek to destroy the nations that come against jerusalem in judah and i will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child john s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that matthew s attempts matthew at least usually excontexts more than just one passage john s errors are grossly obvious and blatant here it does not speak well for any of the gospel writers as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded reckoned with transgressors after his arrest jesus is quickly executed for claiming the jewish kingship messiahship according to one version of the gospel tale jesus gets executed along with two thieves mk and with him they crucified two robbers one on his right one on his left and so the scripture was fulfilled which says he was reckoned with the transgressors here mark is trying to link jesus to a passage in isaiah about the servant nation of israel the passage is not about the messiah for if one reads the whole chapter of isaiah and its surrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a nation the verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past not a prediction of what is to come in any event the servant is thought of as a criminal this also happens to fit the description of jesus had the passage really been about the messiah it still is not at all clear why executing jesus between two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in isaiah jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry he was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with jesus also reviled him this is to be expected from a couple of robbers of course in his later recount st luke decides to change some things luke tells us lk and one of the criminals who was hanged with him railed aren t you the messiah save yourself and us this certainly fits with mark s recount which tells how the people who crucified jesus said save yourself and that the robbers did the same but then luke goes on but the other criminal rebuked the first saying don t you fear g d since you are under the same sentence of condemnation and we indeed justly so for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong and he said jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom and jesus answered verily i say to you today you will be with me in paradise now this little dialogue seems highly contrived it stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech we have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering such a man apparently noble and of principle doesn t seem likely to have been a robber we wonder at the amount of theatrics created by luke of course luke s recount also disagrees with mark s luke has only one criminal revile jesus not both it is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of g d do not have this avenue open this is yet another example of a writer trying to take an old testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology in this case the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we have seen the end of the world mt now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the new testament it is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of christianity jesus mentions the destruction of the jewish temples and buildings and his disciples ask him about this and about the end of the world which he has been warning about the disciples tell us when will this the temple s destruction be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age jesus take care that no one leads you astray for many will come in my name saying i am the christ you will hear of wars and rumours of wars for this must take place but the end is not yet for nation will rise against nation all this is but the beginning of the birthpangs they will deliver you up put you to death and false prophets will arise and lead many astray but he who endures to the end will be saved this gospel will be preached throughout the whole world a testimony to the nations and then the end will come so when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet daniel let those who are in judea flee to the mountains immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened the stars will fall from heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn and see the son of man coming and he will send out his angels and gather his elect learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves you know that summer is near so also when you see all these things you will know that he is near at the very gate truly i say to you this generation will not pass away until all these things take place but of the day and hour no one knows not the angels not the son but only the father therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect from this it is clear that jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples he tells them that although he doesn t know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this holy error but unfortunately jesus made himself to explicit he told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the end and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be swept away there have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the bible and said that the phrase this generation shall not pass away really means this race of people will not pass away of course the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciples it is an interesting notion that when god decided to learn greek he didn t learn it well enough to make himself clear but it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples at least some of them are supposed to live to the end of the world the charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the apostles responses it becomes abundantly clear from rev peter john and rev that jesus meant exactly what he said the end was very near for years christians have rationalised this th chapter of matthew or ignored its meaning altogether for years they have waited for their executed leader to come back hearing of wars and rumours of wars sure that he is coming soon surely he must be all we must do is wait can you imagine how tired he must be sitting around up there being holy waiting for just the right moment to spring so shortly after his crucifixion jesus of nazareth joshua ben joseph died it is said that after three days or three days and three nights or three periods of time or three eternal seconds or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble he was seen again resurrected glowing with divine radiance then the saviour decided it wasn t in the best interests of his new religion to stick around and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven so the story goes anyway as has been seen there were many things attributed to jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down to them jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture we have seen though that this matter is quite shaky but throughout church history christians have held fast to faith in simple belief what doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away from question to question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters thus for years the prophecies cited in the new testament have gone on largely accepted things may well continue that way for some time pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of christianity have been accepted and used properly or improperly to support wars and persecution i suppose there is one prophecy of which christianity can securely keep hold mt jesus don t think that i have come to bring peace on earth i haven t come to bring peace but rather a sword',\n",

a woman s corpse there too she had been well there was part of a body there a hacked off part of a woman s body it was something terrible deposition of roman aleksandrovich gambarian born senior engineer sumgait automotive transport production association resident at building b apartment microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan what happened in sumgait was a great tragedy an awful tragedy for us the armenian people and for all of mankind a genocide of armenians took place during peacetime and it was a great tragedy for me personally because i lost my father in those days he was still young born in on that day february we were at home of course we had heard that there was unrest in town my younger brother aleksandr had told us about it but we didn t think we thought that everything would happen outdoors that they wouldn t go into people s apartments about five o clock we saw a large crowd near the kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict we were sitting at home watching television we go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into mir street this is right near downtown next to the airline ticket office our house is right nearby that day there was a group of policeman with shields there they threw rocks at those policemen then they moved off in the direction of our building they burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and started shouting for armenians to come out of the building we switched off the light as it turns out their signal was just the opposite to turn on the light that meant that it was an azerbaijani home we of course didn t know and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment suddenly there s pounding on the door we go to the door all four of us there were four of us in the apartment father mother my younger brother aleksandr and i he was born in my father was a veteran of world war ii and had fought in china and in the soviet far east he was a pilot we went to the door and they started pounding on it harder breaking it down with axes we start to talk to them in azerbaijani what s going on what s happened they say armenians get out of here we don t open the door we say if we have to leave we ll leave we ll leave tomorrow they say no leave now get out of here armenian dogs get out of here by now they ve broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides we hold them off as best we can my father and i on one side and my mother and brother on the other we had prepared ourselves we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves they broke in the door and when the door gave way we held it for another half hour no neighbors no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time we held the door they started to smash the door on the lock side first with an axe and then with a crowbar when the door gave way they tore it off its hinges sasha hit one of them with the axe the axe flew out of his hands they also had axes crowbars pipes and special rods made from armature shafts one of them hit my father in the head the pressure from the mob was immense when we retreated into the room one of them hit my mother too in the left part of her face my brother sasha and i fought back of course sasha is quite strong and hot tempered he was the judo champion of sumgait we had hammers in our hands and we injured several of the bandits in the heads and in the eyes all that went on but they the injured ones fell back and others came to take their places there were many of them the door fell down at an angle the mob tried to remove the door so as to go into the second room and to continue to finish us off father brought skewers and gave them to sasha and me we flew at them when we saw father bleeding his face was covered with blood he had been wounded in the head and his whole face was bloody we just threw ourselves on them when we saw that we threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall drove them down to the third floor we came out on the landing but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there having closed the door behind them we started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish them then a man an imposing man of about an azerbaijani came in when he was coming in father fell down and mother flew to him and started to cry out i jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen we live on the fourth floor and no one came i went into the room it seemed to me that this man was the leader of the group he was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar and he addressed my mother in azerbaijani what s with you woman why are you shouting what happened why are you shouting like that she says what do you mean what happened you killed somebody my father was a musician he played the clarinet he played at many weddings armenian and azerbaijani he played for many years everyone knew him mother says the person who you killed played at thousands of azerbaijani weddings he brought so much joy to people and you killed that person he says you don t need to shout stop shouting and when they heard the voice of this man the to people who were in the other room opened the door and started running out we chased after them but they ran away that man left too as we were later told downstairs one of them told the others i don t know if it was from fright or what told them that we had firearms even though we only fought with hammers and an axe we raced to father and started to massage his heart but it was already too late we asked the neighbors to call an ambulance the ambulance never came although we waited for it all evening and all through the night somewhere around midnight about policemen came they informed us they were from khachmas they said we heard that a group was here at your place you have our condolences they told us not to touch anything and left father lay in the room so we stayed home each of us took a hammer and a knife we sat at home well we say if they descend on us again we ll defend ourselves somewhere around one o clock in the morning two people came from the sumgait procuracy investigators they say leave everything just how it is we re coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything then people came from the republic procuracy too but no one helped us take father away the morning came and the neighbors arrived we wanted to take father away somehow we called the procuracy and the police a couple of times but no one came we called an ambulance and nobody came then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should hide we secured the door somehow or other we left father in the room and went up to the neighbor s the excesses began again in the morning the bandits came in several vehicles zil panel trucks and threw themselves out of the vehicles like a landing force near the center of town our building was located right there a crowd formed then they started fighting with the soldiers then in buildings and that s next to the airline ticket office they started breaking into armenian apartments destroying property and stealing the armenians weren t at home they had managed to flee and hide somewhere and again they poured in the direction of our building they were shouting that there were some armenians left on the fourth floor meaning us they re up there still up there let s go kill them they broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms threw it outside and burned it in large fires we were hiding one floor up something heavy fell sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably father they had thrown father were defiling the corpse probably throwing it in the fire going to burn it i heard it and the sound was kind of hollow and i said no that s from some of the furniture mother and i pounced on sasha and stopped him somehow and calmed him down the mob left somewhere around eight o clock they smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us they were also armenians they had left for another city the father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said are you crazy why are you hiding armenians don t you now they re checking all the apartments they could kill you and them and to us come on leave this apartment we went down to the third floor to some other neighbors at first the man didn t want to let us in but then one of his sons asked him and he relented we stayed there until eleven o clock at night we heard the sound of motors the neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers we went downstairs there was a light on in the room where we left father in the other rooms as we found out later all the chandeliers had been torn down they left only one bulb the bulb was burning which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our microdistrict where there had been a pogrom with the help of the soldiers we made it to the city party committee and were saved our salvation my mother s my brother s and mine was purely accidental because as we later found out from the neighbors someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up there well we fought but we were only able to save mother we couldn t save father we inflicted many injuries on the bandits some of them serious but others came to take their places we were also wounded there was blood and we were scratched all over we got our share it was a miracle we survived we were saved by a miracle and the troops and if troops hadn t come to sumgait the slaughter would have been even greater probably all the armenians would have been victims of the genocide through an acquaintance at the city party committee i was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us experts we went to pick up father s corpse we took it to the morgue this was about two o clock in the morning it was already march it was raining very hard and it was quite cold and we were wearing only our suits when my brother and i carried father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses there were about six burned people in there and the small corpse of a burned child it was gruesome i suffered a tremendous shock there were about ten people there but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to baku there was a woman s corpse there too she had been well there was part of a body there a hacked off part of a woman s body it was something terrible the morgue was guarded by the landing force the child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old it was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned there was a man there too several men you couldn t tell anything because their faces were disfigured they were in such awful condition now two and a half months have passed every day i recall with horror what happened in the city of sumgait every day my father and the death of my father and how we fought and the people s sorrow and especially the morgue i still want to say that years have passed since soviet power was established and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened in sumgait it will go down in history i m particularly surprised that the mob wasn t even afraid of the troops they even fought the soldiers many soldiers were wounded the mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers setting them on fire they weren t afraid they were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our troops i saw the clashes on february near the airline ticket office right across from our building and that mob was fighting with the soldiers the inhabitants of some of the buildings also azerbaijanis threw rocks at the soldiers from windows balconies even cinder blocks and glass tanks they weren t afraid of them i say they were sure of their impunity when we were at the neighbors and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office i called the police at number and said that they were robbing armenian apartments and burning homes and they told me that they knew that they were being burned during those days no one from the police department came to anyone s aid no one came to help us either to our home even though perhaps they could have come and saved us as we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs near the bus station rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in fighting so i think all of it was arranged in advance they even knew in which buildings and apartments the armenians lived on which floors they had lists the bandits you can tell that the operation was planned in advance thanks of course to our troops to the country s leadership and to the leadership of the ministry of defense for helping us thanks to the russian people because the majority of the troops were russians and the troops suffered losses too i want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all armenians and in the name of all sumgait armenians for coming in time and averting terrible things worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time at present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the ussr procuracy i want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment because if they don t the tragedy the genocide could happen again everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest in the mass disturbances the mobs were huge at present not all of them have been caught very few of them have been i think judging by the newspaper reports there were around people near our building alone that s how many people took part in the pogrom of our building all in all they should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that retribution awaits those who perform such acts may yerevan reference the sumgait tragedy pogroms against armenians in soviet

morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his future he certainly didn t earn his last one how many games did he blow in the world series all of the ones he started he certainly did earn it he was a valuable member of the blue jay team not particularly in the world series during the season he was probably more valuable than say putting olerud out there to pitch but yeah he was valuable in getting them there in the postseason he sucked dirty canal water through a straw the jays won in spite of morris much more than because of him therefore i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing oh yes definitely therefore morris is better than clemens your definition of better refers to some measurement on a scale that has nothing to do with winning ws rings umm roger return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago where the poster valentine was replying to used of ws rings as a measure of better the concept is called context and you should really become familiar with it someday the facts are that morris has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a ws winning club clemens hasn t unless this transaltes to clemens hasn t gone into lou gorman s office with a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he d been traded to the jays i m at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it you can go on about what clemens has done in the past and claim that he is better than morris if you want to but the facts are that morris has shown us that he can win and clemens hasn t what on earth does this mean over their careers clemens has won of the games he s started morris per year clemens has averaged nearly wins morris just under would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning a game if so then consider that clemens allows runs innings pitched morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings in fact jack morris has never in his career had an era for a single year as good as clemens career era but i forget in the maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to buckner missing that grounder in had morris been on the sox it would have been a routine groundout right whether or not clemens is better by your standard of measurement is totally meaningless the object of the game is not to compile high figures in statistics that you have chosen to feel are important the object of the game is to contribute to ws victories but this has been patiently explained to you many many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it speaking of stupid it has been patiently and not so patiently explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask don t give me that shit if boston had alomar olerud henke and ward while toronto had rivera jack clark jeff reardon things would have looked a little different last fall give credit where credit is due this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick yes and the dog would have caught the rabbit too forget about what didn t happen and open your eyes for once and look out there and see what is really happening forget about how morris shouldn t have won with an era over when morris pitched last year the jays won stop crying about it and get on with life no one is crying the jays won and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the al east they performed well in two short series and won the world series and i congratulate them for it as a red sox fan i hope they keep morris i was happy when they picked up stewart and elated when they traded for darrin jackson you see unless you believe in some mystical link between morris and the offense you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky luck runs out just like it did in when he pitched odd more innings than gave up exactly one earned run more than in and went seriously roger i d really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the morris and the morris which

please can you tell us why those quotes are crap because you do not like them because they really exist why as i said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source given by serdar argic you couldn t reject it in addition the author s preface was written on january but the book was published in here we go again in the book i have both the front page and the author s preface give the same year and january respectively anyone can check it at her his library if not i can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct i really don t care what year it was first published or what i care about is what the book writes about murders tortures et in the given quotes by serdar argic and your denial of these quotes and your groundless accussations etc dd i can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim vd what is new i will post a gif file but i am not going go through the effort to show there is some turkish modified re publication of the book like last time i claim i have a book in my hand published in first publication and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published in serdar argic s reference has you couldn t reject it but now you are avoiding the real issues by twisting around let s see how you lie from non existing quotes to re publication first you said there was no such a quote in the given reference you called serdar argic a liar i said to you no mr davidian there exactly existed such a quote i even gave the call number page numbers you could t reject it and now you are lying again and talking about modified re published book without any proof how when where by whom etc by the way how is it possible to re publish the book in if it was first published in your claim i am sure that you have some pretty well suited theories as usual and i am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who wants to compare the fact and mr davidian s lies i also give the call number and page numbers again for the library use which are r and the page numbers to verify the quotes and it is not possible that s text has pages mine has and yours has now are you claiming that there can t be such a reference by saying it is not possible if not what is your point differences in the number of pages mine was published in serdar argic s was in no need to use the same book size and the same letter charachter in both publications etc etc does it give you an idea the issue was not the number of pages the book has or the year first published and you tried to hide the whole point the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed tortured etc by armenians and those quotes given by serdar argic exist it was the issue wasn t it you were not able to object it does it bother you anyway you

       " 'from daveb pogo wv tek com dave butler subject re new biblical contradictions still not answered judas organization tektronix inc wilsonville or lines mr decenso in spite of requiring scholarly opinion on the hanging of judas rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases those scholars opinion on the subject we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably records his death although it s possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks thereby bursting open i can no longer assume that to be the case therefore no contradiction matthew did not say judas died as a result of the hanging did he most scholars believe he iprobably did but i quoted all that to show that i highly regard the scholars explanations but in looking at the texts initially we can t assume judas died it is however highly probable and also there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure it simply means hang oneself actually if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw you will find that it does denote success those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful as i pointed out i recently checked several lexicons greek english lexicon of the new testament louw and nida robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new testament greek english lexicon of the new testament grimm word study concordance tynsdale a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other early christian writings bauer arndt gingrich the new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher a couple simply stated hanged oneself and a couple were more explicit and stated that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hanging a couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for apacgw is strangle throttle or choke which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to david joslin that judas was hung upside down one of the best references though robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new testament not only stated the translation it gave both the root words the literal translation related greek words which use the same roots and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature to give further context the word apagchw has two root words gchw is the to strangle root and the root word apo means literally away this root words is included in words which denote a transition it can mean a transition in place eg the greek word apagello means to send a message apo can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death robinson specifically makes comparison to the word apokteiuo which means to kill in literal meaning the word apacgw means to throttle strangle to put out of the way and implicitly denotes a change in life state ie away from life to death so while the word apacgw does mean to hang it specifically denotes a death as well thus robinson is quite specific when he state that it means to hang oneself to end one s life by hanging he then notes the the use of apacgw in homers odessy to denote context he presents that example of apacgw as being used to explicitly mean suicide by hanging now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling without the added denotation of death and as you insist that the bible was written by god and every word is precicely correct you are stuck with the complete meaning of apacgw ie since the word apacgw was used then death is denoted as the result by the way i note that mr decenso also presents an example of apacgw in the septuagint the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesus it s only used in samuel now when ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed he saddled a donkey and arose and went home to his house to his city then he put his household in order and hanged himself and died and he was buried in his father s tomb notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel hanged himself gr sept apagcho but it explicitly adds and died here we have no doubt of the result in matthew we are not explicitly told judas died note mr decenso as you say the septuagint was a translation from hebrew to greek and you have not shown the original meaning of the hebrew ie the the hebrew say and died and thus whether it was simply echoed in the greek it should also be pointed out that regardless of the added and died the correct translation would still be apacgw as the man did indeed die from strangulation redundant but correct further we have evidence that the septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited which included versions which contradicted each other and such editing was not even necessarily executed by greeks thus i am not sure that you can use the septuagint as it now stands as a paragon of ancient greek so what you really need to prove your point mr decenso is an example in ancient greek of someone committing apacgw and surviving otherwise i would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence now i would note mr decenso that everytime i go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis i pretty much find it false thus i think that if you are going to add to the text something over and above what the source clearly says then you had better have an explicit greek or historical source to justify it by the way as to mr rose s statement about trees around the potter s field there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom unless mr rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old or that there are year old stumps there or has a thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago after all things change now as to your other argument ie that the money judas used is not the same as the silvers as to your second question mr decenso you ask how we could be sure that the money with which judas purchased the land was indeed for the betrayal rather than some other source i would point out that in acts where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity acts it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about ie acts concerning judas who was guide to those who arrested jesus now i would point out that when the bible describes an act of iniquity and then immediately discusses the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed notice that in verse the word iniquity is not used rather it states that judas became a guide to those who arrested jesus but the writer did not stop there vs for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry what part did judas play in their ministry true peter or the author of acts does not specifically call judas betrayal an iniquity but for that matter neither does john specifically call judas actions an iniquity either further john did not say that judas took the money box but rather said some thought that because judas had the money box jesus was telling him buy what we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor so after receiving the morsel he immediately went out and it was night note that it is said that judas left it does not say that he took the money box thus when i see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity mentioned by another author in a different book written at a different time over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts i find this forced and contrived of course this particular argument becomes moot since we have have seen evidence that apacgw means suicide you see since judas hanging was successful he could not have spent the money mentioned in john because matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day ie passover and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day thus the money which bought the field of blood would have to have been the pieces of silver of course he got the pieces of silver that night as well and thus couldn t have spent that either oh dear i believe that the house of cards is comming down maybe we should at this point discuss now whether jesus was crucified on friday or saturday as that is now part of the argument about judas by the way as to where the prophesy of the potter s field came from ie the mention of it in matthew you say please when we are done with this study on his death remind me to discuss this with you i am reminding you now to discuss it now it s all part of the same verse we are discussing and i wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping these issues later dave butler a wise man proportions his belief to the evidence david hume philosopher an inquiry concerning human understanding ps i would note again that you are not stating that that bible is not possibly inerrant you are stating that it is inerrant since you have been by your own admission presenting merely possible reconciliations i of course don t rate them that highly then the best you can do is say that the bible is possibly inerrant not that it is inerrant',\n",
